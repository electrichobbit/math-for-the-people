<p>There are a few rules that all states must abide by when drawing their districts:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Districts must be roughly equal in population ("one person, one vote").</li>
<li>Districts must be contiguous (one connected shape).</li>
<li>Districts must comply with racial fairness via the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (see <a href="module-tag-math-topic-statistics.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.7: Racial Gerrymandering and Statistics">SectionÂ 1.7</a> for more information).</li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">Redistricting can be controversial due to who draws the lines in each state. While some states have independent redistricting commissions comprised of citizens or politicians equally representing the two main political parties, other states' processes are controlled by the political party in power of the state government. When in control, this incentivizes a political party to manipulate the maps in an effort to maximize their own future representation. The manipulation of drawing districts to benefit one group is called <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">gerrymandering</dfn> and will be explored mathematically and politically in this module.</p>

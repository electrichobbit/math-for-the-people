<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><dfn class="terminology">Partisan gerrymandering</dfn> is the practice of drawing district lines to maximize a political party's advantage in elected representatives. This can often be seen in states where the representatives by party are vastly disproportionate from the voter affiliations. For example, consider Pennsylvania's 2012 elections, the first statewide elections following the 2011 redistricting. Almost 58% of voters registered with one of the two major parties (Democratic and Republican) were registered as Democrats <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PA-2012-voter-registration.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 1.12.4">[1.12.4]</a>, but Republicans (who controlled the redistricting process) won 13 of the 18 House elections, just over 72% of the seats. This extreme difference led to a 2018 challenge in court and in <em class="emphasis">League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania v. the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</em>, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that this was a case of partisan gerrymandering that violated the state constitution and thus a new map needed to be drawn <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/LWV-PA-remedial-plan.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 1.12.5">[1.12.5]</a>. Notably, the November 2018 elections using the new map yielded 9 representatives for each party, demonstrating the impact of the previous map.</p>

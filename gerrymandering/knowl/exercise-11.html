<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">When using grid examples, it is often easy for populations to be equal in every district, but on real maps, some deviation is allowed. The <dfn class="terminology">population deviation</dfn> of a district plan is the percentage difference between the most populous and least populous districts, relative to the <em class="emphasis">ideal population</em> (the population if all districts were equal).</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">For example, suppose a state with 1,000,000 people was divided into 10 districts. The most populous district contains 102,300 people and the least populous district contains 98,400 people. This means that the ideal population is 100,000 and the population deviation is 3.9%.</p>\(\frac{102,300-98,400}{100,000}=.039=3.9\%\)<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Courts have dictated that the maximum allowed population deviation is 0.75% for congressional plans and 10% for state legislative plans.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Suppose a state is planning to create new congressional districts and proposes a plan in which their 3 districts have the following populations:</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li>District #1: 232,934</li>
<li>District #2: 231,956</li>
<li>District #3: 231,158</li>
</ol>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Calculate the ideal population and the population deviation for this plan. Would this proposal be allowed to move forward based on population alone?</p>

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Suppose a state with a population of 2,300,000 is set to create new district plans for 8 congressional districts and 40 state legislative districts</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li>The congressional proposal's least populous district has a population of 286,790. What is the maximum population allowed for another district?</li>
<li>The state legislative proposal's most populous district has a population of 59,440. What is the minimum population allowed for another district?</li>

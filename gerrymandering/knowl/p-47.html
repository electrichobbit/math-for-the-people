<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In the example above, we calculate that the efficiency gap is approximately \(4 \% \text{.}\) But what does that mean? Does it suggest gerrymandering occurred? What does the model consider to be “fair”? If both parties waste the same number of votes, the efficiency gap would be \(0\text{.}\) This is considered “perfectly fair”. The farther the percentage from \(0\text{,}\) the more unfair the map. If we multiply the percentage by the number of districts, we get the advantage for the dominant party in terms of seats. In the above example, there are 5 districts, so the advantage for the Club party is \(4 \% \times 5\) districts \(= 0.2\) seats. In the original paper introducing the efficiency gap <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/gerrymandering-efficiency-gap.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 1.12.18">[1.12.18]</a>, the authors defined a threshold for partisan gerrymandering as an advantage of at least two seats for congressional plans and at least 8 percent for legislative plans. Following that guideline, the district plan and election above do not show evidence of gerrymandering.</p>

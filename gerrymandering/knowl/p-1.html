<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Gerrymandering is the act of defining the boundaries of electoral districts to benefit a party or politician. In countries where there is a single voting district, such as Israel (see <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Israel-voting.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 1.12.8">[1.12.8]</a>), or where electoral district boundaries are fixed, such as Sweden (see mention of constituencies in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Sweden-voting.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 1.12.7">[1.12.7]</a>), this practice is eliminated. However, in many countries it is an ongoing concern when evaluating the fairness of electoral representation. Though it is not a phenomenon unique to the United States of America, this chapter will focus on its history in that country. The term <em class="emphasis">gerrymandering</em> is named after American politician Elbridge Gerry (pronounced with a hard "g"), who, as then-Governor of Massachusetts, signed a bill in 1812 that created a partisan district in the Boston area that was compared to the shape of a salamander. (For more on Gerry and the Massachusetts map, see <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/history-Gerry.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 1.12.19">[1.12.19]</a>.)</p>

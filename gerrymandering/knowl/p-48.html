<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">NOTE: Since its introduction, some shortcomings of the efficiency gap have been raised (see <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/formula-to-court.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 1.12.1">[1.12.1]</a> for some discussion). Importantly, it sets the \(75 \% / 25 \%\) vote split as the ideal outcome - but is that appropriate? The efficiency gap uses only wasted votes totals in its computation, without regard to how competitive elections were in each district or the geography of the region.  Also, the +2 seat advantage is much more likely in larger states. How useful, then, is the calculation of the efficiency gap? As with other measures, note that it is one of many tools that could be used.</p>

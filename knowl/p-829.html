<p>RIPA formed an advisory board comprised of community stakeholders and academic researchers. Each year the board analyzes stop data and releases reports on disparities in policing, which are then used by communities around the state to advocate for changes in both funding and accountability measures for police. As a result of the data, cities like Berkeley, Oakland, San Diego, and Los Angeles have started taking steps towards significant changes to police practices.</p>

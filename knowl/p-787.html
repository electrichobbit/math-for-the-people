<p>What if we look at the exact same scenario, but the borrower borrows the money for a year?  Then they will pay back a total of</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
A = 300 + 300*4.60*1 = \$1680
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">The borrower ends up paying $1,680 total, so $1,380 in interest.  If they default on the loan, they also end up paying late fee (possibly more than one, but let's assume just one).  We can calculate the expected value for the payday lender:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
0.20*(-300) + 0.26*(1380+25) + 0.54*(1380) = \$1050.50
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">For every borrower that pays their loan back after a year of fees, on average, the lender can expect to earn $1050.50!  This illustrates the fundamental mechanic of payday lending - the lenders make more money if they lend to borrowers who can just barely afford to pay the loan back.  They have a vested interest in lending to people who are struggling to get by instead of those who are dealing with an unexpected emergency.</p>

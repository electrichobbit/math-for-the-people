<p>In the wake of racial justice protests in 2020, the publicâ€™s attention was also turned to the presence of police in schools, and the disproportionate impact that this presence has on students of color, primarily Black and Indigenous students. According to the National Center for Education Statistics <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-NCES-firearm.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.138">[8.12.138]</a>, 61.4% of the public schools in 2017-2018 had one or more security staff. The number of police officers in schools especially exploded after the mass shooting in Columbine High School in 1999, as a consequence of which the government began to offer federal grants to schools for hiring police officers in an effort to increase school security. Twenty years later, over 200,000 students are being referred to law enforcement every year <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-CRights-estimates.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.142">[8.12.142]</a>. Some of these referrals are arrests with or without charges filed, while others are citations. Students are referred to law enforcement for offenses as minor as talking back to a teacher or having a fight with a classmate <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-NEA-STP.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.134">[8.12.134]</a>. Because students who have contact with law enforcement are more likely to drop out of school and/or end up incarcerated <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-NBER-STP.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.130">[8.12.130]</a>, this increased criminalization of youth behavior has become known as the school-to-prison pipeline. However, contact with law enforcement is not the only problem. Closely related to it is the problem of school discipline. In 2017-18, over 2.5 million students received an out-of-school suspension, and over 2.6 million received an in-school suspension <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-CRights-estimates.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.142">[8.12.142]</a>. Frequent suspensions can also lead to dropout <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-NBER-STP.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.130">[8.12.130]</a>, and, as they are usually at the discretion of teachers and administrators, can be used indiscriminately <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-NEA-STP.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.134">[8.12.134]</a> <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-Texas-study.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.133">[8.12.133]</a>, leading to disparities.</p>

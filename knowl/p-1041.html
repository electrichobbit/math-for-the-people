<p>In contrast, private student loans are loans offered by non-governmental companies which are heavily advertised, do not offer the relatively generous forbearance and deferred-payment options that federal loans do, and charge interest while the borrower is in college. Often, private student loan interest rates are higher even than those of unsubsidized federal student loans. Since many students do not have a credit history, federal student loans do not require proof of, or a co-signer attesting, "creditworthiness", or evidence of past ability to repay debt; as of the <span class="process-math">\(2010\)</span>s, most private student loans required such proof <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/consumerfinancialprotectionbureauPrivateStudentLoans2012.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 9.11.148: Private Student Loans: Report to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, The House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services, and the House of Representatives Committee on Education and the Workforce">[9.11.148]</a>. Additionally, students who declare bankruptcy are unable to discharge private student loans, meaning borrowers who have no money are still required to pay private corporations back for student loans <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ExceptionsDischarge.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 9.11.153: Exceptions to Discharge">[9.11.153]</a>. Therefore, the U.S. government earns more income from student loans, but profits less, on average, than private student loan companies.</p>

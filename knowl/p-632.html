<p>This module is primarily concerned with understanding how payday loans work.  On the surface, payday loans may seem like a pretty good deal - but when carefully compared with other types of loans, we'll see that they can actually end up costing the borrower a lot of money.  We'll look at how they compare to other types of loans that are available to people with better credit scores</p>

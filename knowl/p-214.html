<p>Many news reports containing quantitative results will give, at best, a cursory view of the error in those results. Journalists donâ€™t have an infinite amount of column inches to devote to the story. Researchers often are limited by the number of pages they can publish for a journal article. But realize that every one of these numerical results has sources of error, often significant or even huge, and many of them will not be exposed. It is up to the reader to think through them.</p>

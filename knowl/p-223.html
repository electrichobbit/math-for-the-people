<p>Along the bottom, we see the years marked off in even increments. On graphs, the bottom line starting on the left and going right is the x-axis. On the left side, the temperature range is indicated. It shows the change in average temperature for each year relative to the temperature in the year 1 CE. That left side line with increments of some important variable is the y-axis. In some cases, the x-axis represents time and the y-axis indicates the degree of some phenomena. In other graphs you might see the x-axis as a causal variable and the y-axis as indicating some outcome. So, in the context of climate change, you might see a graph with the amount of carbon emissions on the x-axis and the average world temperature on the y-axis so the viewer can see how the two are related.</p>

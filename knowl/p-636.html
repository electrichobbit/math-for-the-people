<p>Many people take out bank loans to make major purchases, like homes or cars.  A <em class="emphasis">mortgage</em> is a bank loan which uses a home or piece of property as a security.  Many people use a mortgage to borrow money to buy a home.  If they fail to repay the loan, the bank gets to take the security - in this case, their home.  When the bank takes the security from the loan, it is called a <em class="emphasis">foreclosure</em> (usually used with homes and property) or a <em class="emphasis">reposession</em> (usually used with vehicles like cars or boats).  The result is the same - the bank takes the property which was used to secure the loan.  They are then able to sell that property to earn back the money that they loaned out.  Interest rates for these types of loans tend to be much lower, because the opportunity to foreclose on the property gives the bank a way to earn their money back even if the borrower does not repay the loan.</p>

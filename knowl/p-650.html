<p>The lack of banks in majority Black neighborhoods is mirrored by a greater concentration of payday lenders.  A 2016 study in California found that the neighborhoods where payday lenders were concentrated were much more likely to be majority Black or Latinx <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-payday-lending-in-black-neighborhoods.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 6.11.1.105: The Demographics of California Payday Lending: A Zip Code Analysis of Storefront Locations">[6.11.1.105]</a>.  A 2020 survey found that Black respondents were more than twice as likely to say that they lived within one mile of a payday lender <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-payday-lending-race-survey.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 6.11.1.106: ‘It’s What We Call Reverse Redlining’: Measuring the Proximity of Payday Lenders, Pawn Shops to Black Adults">[6.11.1.106]</a>. This lack of access to low-interest lenders, coupled with easy access to high-interest lenders, is called <em class="emphasis">reverse redlining</em>.  Redlining was the (now illegal) practice of singling out minority neighborhoods for mortgage discrimination, denying loans to people buying homes in those neighborhoods.  Redlining is considered a major contributor to the generational wealth gap between Black and white americans.  Similarly, reverse redlining creates neighborhoods without access to low-interest credit - not because of bank policies, per se, but because of physical proximity to lending institutions.</p>

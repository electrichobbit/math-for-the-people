<p>Political districts exist at different levels of government. First, the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives each correspond to one district in one of the 50 states. The number of districts in each state is roughly proportional to that state's population, with the exact number determined by a mathematical algorithm known as the Huntington-Hill Method. As of the 2020 Census, the top six states in representatives are California (with 52), Texas (38), Florida (28), New York (26), Illinois (17), and Pennsylvania (17). Another six states have only a single representative (statewide district): Delaware, South Dakota, North Dakota, Alaska, Vermont, and Wyoming.</p>

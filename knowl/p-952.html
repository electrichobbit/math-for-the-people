<p>Our first step to exploring the claim in the document is to think about the probability that we want to build. If you are a student going to school, when it comes to being arrested, you either get arrested at school or you don’t get arrested at school. So we have two groups of students, those that get arrested and those that don’t get arrested. We also happen to know about the number of students that get arrested, as well as how many students there are. This means that we have everything we need.</p>

<p>If we cannot get accurate information, then people cannot solve problems together. If people cannot agree on what the problems are, how widespread they are, and how effective various solutions are, they will not be able to work on making life better for everyone. If we as a people do not make any progress, then the people who stand to gain from the current system continue to benefit. When no one can agree on how to solve problems, then the people who benefit from the existence of the problems will continue to receive those benefits.</p>

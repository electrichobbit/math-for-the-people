<p>Numerous studies have found that students who are arrested at school or who have been suspended are more likely to drop out of school and have continued contact with law enforcement. A recent study <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-harvard.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.131">[8.12.131]</a> found that in Charlotte-Mecklenberg school district in North Carolina, students who were assigned to schools with higher suspension rates were significantly more likely to be arrested and incarcerated as adults, and less likely to attend a four-year college. Furthermore, the results were independent of which students were assigned to the schools (the study took place during a redrawing of school boundaries when over 50% of the students in the district were assigned to different schools), or of factors like teacher turnover. Instead, the suspension rates were most influenced by school policies and leadership.</p>

<p>We can reduce this to a decimal figure, as finding common factors or a reduced form fraction is highly unlikely. This yields approximately 0.001625.Now we want to know how this fits with thinking about the probability of being arrested per 10,000 students. In other words, if the probability of getting arrested is 0.001625, this is about 0.1625%; how many arrests would that be among 10,000 students? We use this previously calculated value and solve an equation, to find a value out of 10000:</p>

<p>Every day children of all ages, from preschool to high school, get disciplined at school. The form of discipline varies, from being sent to the principal’s office all the way to being arrested or expelled. Who gets disciplined at school, and for which offenses and behaviors? And what is the phenomenon that people refer to as the “school-to-prison pipeline”? In this module, you will use ratios, percents, data analysis, and probability to try to answer these and other questions.</p>

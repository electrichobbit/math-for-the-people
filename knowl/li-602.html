<p>Use the <a class="external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lbB5OSSsxrwQdDh5Px8fqMSRRwwvxseg/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=113361107850751941418&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true/copy" target="_blank">Excel spreadsheet on undergrad and grad tuition/fees from the National Center for Education Statistics</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-153-hidden.html" title="Footnote 9.6.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> (make a copy first) and/or the <a class="external" href="student-loans/data-files/nces-tuition.xlsx" target="_blank">Excel version of this table</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-154-hidden.html" title="Footnote 9.6.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> on undergrad tuition by nonprofit status and college private/public status to do the following:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Create a graph, trendline, and interpret the <span class="process-math">\(R^{2}\)</span> value for each type of institution: public nonprofit, private nonprofit, private for-profit. What does it mean? Use it to predict average tuition and fees across the country in the current year. How accurate is your prediction?</p></li>
<li>
<p>Fit the data to a polynomial function (of least degree). We'll talk about how to do this in class, so let me know when you reach this step. For your reference, the steps in Excel are:</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>Left-click on your graph. In the top menu under <em class="emphasis">Chart Tools</em> , click Design.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Add Chart Element -&gt; Trendline -&gt; More trendline options. Click on the data you want to make a trendline for.</p></li>
<li><p>In the right sidebar, select Polynomial and play around with the <em class="emphasis">Order</em> until you get a good fit for your data.</p></li>
<li><p>Check <em class="emphasis">Display Equation on chart</em> and <em class="emphasis">Display R-squared value on chart</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, our goal is to get all our <span class="process-math">\(R^{2}\)</span> values larger than roughly 0.96, which is a very large degree of accuracy. If some of your trendlines have <span class="process-math">\(R^{2}\leq0.96\text{,}\)</span> double-click on the offending trendline(s) until the sidebar comes up and increase the <em class="emphasis">Order</em> of your polynomial until <span class="process-math">\(R^{2}&gt;0.96\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>What trends over time do you notice in each the three graphs? Describe trends in words, using phrases like <em class="emphasis">increasing</em>, <em class="emphasis">decreasing</em>, <em class="emphasis">increasing slope</em>, <em class="emphasis">decreasing slope</em>. What overall trend do we notice that's common to all three graphs over time?</p></li>
<li>
<p>The <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>-squared value that I asked you to show in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/student-loans-r-squared-nonprofit.html" title="Item 6.a">Item 6.a</a> above measures what proportion of the variation in the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-variable is explained by the trendline. For instance, <span class="process-math">\(R^{2}=1\)</span> means that <span class="process-math">\(100\%\)</span> of the variation in y is explained by the trendline, so the trendline is a perfect fit. Conversely, <span class="process-math">\(R^{2}=0\)</span> means that the trendline explains <span class="process-math">\(0\%\)</span> of the variation in the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> variable, so this trendline doesn't fit the data at all.</p>
<p>What percentage of the variation in two-year public college tuition (<span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>) is explained by the variation in year (<span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>)? What about when <span class="process-math">\(y=\)</span> four-year private college tuition? Four-year public college tuition?</p>
</li>
<li><p><dfn class="terminology">Outliers</dfn> are data that fall far away from the trendline. What outliers do you notice, if any? Interpret these outliers in context: what do they mean for tuition and fees over time, and what possible historical explanations could there be for these outliers?</p></li>
<li>
<p><dfn class="terminology">Polynomials</dfn> are a special type of mathematical function, or process for turning one number into another. Polynomials are functions of the form <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+a_{1}x^{1}+a_{0}\text{:}\)</span> sums of powers of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> maybe with constant terms in front. For example, <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x+1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(g(x)=17x^{3}-234x+7\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h(x)=-x^{1}42+1\)</span> are all polynomials. The polynomial <span class="process-math">\(a(x)=x^{2}+2x+3\)</span> takes the input 1 and turns it into the output <span class="process-math">\(1^{2}+2(1)+3=6\text{.}\)</span> All numbers which make sense to input are called the <dfn class="terminology">domain</dfn> of the function, and the possible sensical outputs you could get are called the <dfn class="terminology">range</dfn>.</p>
<p>What is the domain and range of each of the polynomial trendlines?</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>Use this model to predict the tuition cost for a student entering each type of institution in the academic year <span class="process-math">\(2020\)</span>-<span class="process-math">\(2021\text{.}\)</span> How accurate do you think your prediction is?</p></li>

<p>The file <a class="external" href="greenhouse-gas/data-files/owid-emissions-by-country.csv" target="_blank">Emissions by Country/Region</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-84-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.10.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/greenhouse-gas-biblio-owid-full-data.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 5.11.1.92">[5.11.1.92]</a> gives data for countries and regions around the world.  The data includes:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Country Name</p></li>
<li><p>Population</p></li>
<li><p>Total CO2 Emissions in 2021.</p></li>
<li><p>CO2 Emissions per capita - the total CO2 emissions divided by the population in 2021.</p></li>
<li><p>Cumulative CO2 emissions over history.</p></li>
<li><p>The change in atmostpheric CO2 due to land use.  This can be positive or negative - if countries plant more trees, for example, that would reduce atmospheric CO2, while clearing land or changing how it is used can increase emissions.</p></li>
<li><p>CO2 emissions from land use per capita.</p></li>
<li><p>Share of CO2 emissions in 2021, as a percentage of global emissions in 2021.</p></li>
<li><p>Share of cumulative global CO2 emissions over time, as a percentage of cumulative global emissions.</p></li>
<li><p>Share of temperature change from greenhouse gas emissions.  Certain changes or types of emissions can have larger effects on temperature change, so this may be different that then the percentage of CO2 emissions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">Use the data in the spreadsheet to answer these questions:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Create a graph of the total CO2 emissions of the 10 countries with the highest emissions in the list.  What kind of graph did you choose to make and why?</p></li>
<li><p>Create a graph which shows the percentage share of CO2 that each continent or region (the continents/regions listed are Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, and South America) has emitted.  What kind of graph did you choose to make and why?</p></li>
<li><p>Taking all the countries with populations smaller than the USA, create a graph which shows the relationship between population and the percentage of CO2 emissions which the country is responsible for.  What kind of graph did you choose and why? Does there seem to be a relationship between the size of the country and the percentage of CO2 emissions they're responsible for.</p></li>

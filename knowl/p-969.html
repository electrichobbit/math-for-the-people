<p>Black students have a 17% chance of being suspended. Suppose two separate Black students get called to the principal's office. Let’s explore the probability of both students receiving the same outcome, meaning either both students get suspended or neither student gets suspended. We will assume that the students’ visits to the principal are for separate offenses. What is the probability that both students are suspended?</p>

<li><p>It is important to learn that a quantitative claim can be true, but still be misleading.  Here, the claim that just 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions is (up to some uncertainty in the exact numbers) factually correct - but it is missing some important context.  Read through the article and do some research on your own.  What do most of the companies listed in this study do? What kinds of products do they produce?</p></li>
<li><p>Based on your research in the previous problem, how is the author using the term "responsible" here? Do you agree that these companies are responsible for 71% of emissions?</p></li>
<li>This tweet from April 2021 refers to the claim in the headline: <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="fake-news/images/emissions-bitcoin.png" class="contained"></div>

<li><p>What would be a better way to state the claim being made in the headline? Write your own headline which would present the same quantitative information in a less misleading way.</p></li>

<p>"Given the importance of these providers, experts and professional organizations provide recommended student-to-SBHM provider ratios. The American School Counselor Association recommends a ratio of 250 students per counselor. The National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) recommends a ratio of 500-700 students per school psychologist, depending on the comprehensiveness of services being provided. School Social Work Association of America (SSWAA) recommends that social work services should also be provided at a ratio of 250 students to one social worker. Several states, along with the American Nurses Association, recommend a ratio of one school nurse to 750 students in healthy student populations."</p>

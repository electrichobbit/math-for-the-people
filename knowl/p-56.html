<p>Now we have a secondary set to think about: people getting abortions. The question that we have to ask ourselves becomes: Will abortions still happen if abortions are not federally protected? In prior sections, we discussed that some abortions are medically necessary. There are also (while often dramatized for television, like Law and Order: SVU (see Season 12, Episode 9: “Gray” as a specific example) scenarios where one partner in a couple will go to desperate lengths to terminate a pregnancy.  A medication is administered to terminate the pregnancy. One issue that was debated during the episode was if the action of the partner was technically an abortion. The court determined that it met the legal definition of an abortion because medical means were used to terminate a pregnancy. We use this example, not only because it is widely available via the internet, but to demonstrate that abortion does not require a medical practitioner. This means that even without clinics and medical practitioners, abortions will still happen. This means that overlaying the second set gives us a diagram that looks something like the set diagram below.</p>

<p>Another strategy is to ask specific questions that relate to why you personally have issues with the argument, and why you believe it to contain a fallacy. If you have questions about the diagnosis of mental disability during pregnancy, as an example, asking questions can help clarify meaning for both parties. You can get information about the meaning of mental disability from the other party because perhaps they have a different definition than what you have. This clarification is something that you could not have gained without having a productive discussion with another person. That is why it is a general strategy for exploring and refuting arguments.</p>

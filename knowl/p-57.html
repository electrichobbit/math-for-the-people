<p>We can see that the set of people who will get an abortion is evenly split over the two scenarios of abortion being federally protected or not being federally protected. This means that when we think about the original statement, “If abortions are not federally protected, then no one will get an abortion,” we can see that this is a false statement as long as the set of people who will get an abortion is not an empty set. We have strong reason to believe that this set is not empty, both from the example from the Law and Order example as well as the case of medical abortions mentioned previously.</p>

<p>In summary, in Hartford between April 2014 and September 2016, it seems as though Black drivers were not stopped disproportionately. Stopped Black drivers were searched or frisked at a slightly higher rate than stopped white drivers, and contraband was found on a slightly higher percentage of searched or frisked white drivers than searched or frisked Black drivers. While we cannot make any definitive conclusions based on our analysis, it seems as though there was a small anti-Black bias in vehicular stops and searches, but there did not seem to be large-scale, widespread racial disparities. You should edit the blocks of code above and see what conclusions you can make for the Philadelphia data.</p>

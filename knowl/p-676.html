<p>For example, imagine you borrow $100 at 5% interest for 10 years.  With simple interest, you would add 5% of $100 - $5 - each year for 10 years, for a total of $50 worth of interest.  You would end up owing $150 after 10 years.  If you were paying 5% interest <em class="emphasis">compounded annually</em>, though, you would take 5% of the amount each year - including any interest that has already accumulated.</p>

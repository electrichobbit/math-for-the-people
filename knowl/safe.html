</h3>Consider the statement: “A student feels safe to be themselves at school.” <ol class="decimal">
<li><p>What outcomes are possible?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there reasons that might cause students to feel  unsafe about being themselves?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you think a student being themselves could make another student uncomfortable? Why or why not?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The possible outcomes are {a student feels safe, a student does not feel safe}, and that makes sense. The probability of a student feeling safe to be themselves will result in 1 out of 2 outcomes, but can we reliably predict which outcome we see? Ideally, students feeling safe to be themselves at school should be the only outcome we expect to see. In reality, we find that students do not feel safe to be themselves at school for any number of reasons. Consider the following quote: “The teachers … they thought we were selling weed in school, they thought that me and her were both selling weed ‘cause like, the way we were dressing, ‘cause we were the only girls at that middle school that dressed like boys. So it was like 'now we’re bad'.” (non-gender conforming youth from Arizona) <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-article-LGBTQ-youth.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.140: Messy, Butch, and Queer: LGBTQ Youth and the School-to-Prison Pipeline,">[8.12.140]</a>. In this quote, the student was exposed to a negative experience, accusations of illegal activity, because of choices associated with how they chose to express who they believed themself to be.</p>
<p>Making Sense: Think back to your experiences in school. Identify if there were similar incidents to the incident described above in your community. Do you think that how people were seen by others influenced their behavior, meaning if a label was applied to a person did they adapt to the label? Or do you think that the person stayed the same?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="school-discipline-math-topic-probability.html#safe" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

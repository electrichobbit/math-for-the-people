<p>The second table includes all of the drivers who were searched or frisked. Notice that contraband was found for 8 of the 925 searched or frisked Black drivers, or <span class="process-math">\(0.9\%\text{,}\)</span> and for 10 of the 835 searched or frisked white drivers, or <span class="process-math">\(1.2\%\text{.}\)</span> We see that the proportion of white drivers who were stopped or frisked and who possess contraband is slightly higher than that for Black drivers. It is therefore possible that officers are searching Black drivers on less evidence than they are for white drivers.</p>

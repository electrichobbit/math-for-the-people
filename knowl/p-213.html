<p>But here’s how politics come into play. Climate policy makers, and climate deniers, use a parameter called the “social cost of carbon” to “monetize” the effects of climate change. This is a very complex analysis. But realize that the Environmental Protection Agency in the Obama administration used a figure around $50/ton carbon, while Trump administration officials revised the analysis and came up with a figure of around $7/ton. How could such an important figure be so different? The answer is that the analysis involves several key assumptions. Change the assumptions and you can drastically change the result.</p>

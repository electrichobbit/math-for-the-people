<p>One question that you may have is why the statement, "All abortions are medically necessary," is not a valid negation. It may in fact be a valid negation, but we have to meet some specific criteria for it to be valid. Letâ€™s talk about what needs to happen for the negation with "All abortions are medically necessary," to be valid. The statement implies that all of the abortions in the set of all abortions are also in the set of abortions for medical reasons. Now let's consider our original statement, "Some abortions are medically necessary." It is logically equivalent to the statement, "Not all abortions are medically necessary." The negation of this equivalent statement happens when we state that there are no members in the set of all abortions that are not also in the set of abortions for medical reasons. This is a more complicated process because it is not direct. We created an equivalent statement that was then negated. Typically the more steps that are involved in a process, the more room you have to make errors. Logic is no exception.</p>

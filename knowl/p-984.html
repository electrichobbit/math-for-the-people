<p>You probably notice from doing this exploration that the number of SROs and the number of schools with SROs has gone up. According to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-ACLU-report.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.129">[8.12.129]</a>, “Following the 1999 Columbine High School shooting, President Clinton called for the first round of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grants as a response that would allow for school/police partnerships focused on 'school crime, drug use, and discipline problems.'' COPS is a unit of the U.S. Department of Justice. After the Sandy Hook tragedy in 2012, President Obama allocated another $45 million into COPS to fund additional school police. Federal grants were supplemented by state grants and local monies to sustain SRO programs.”</p>

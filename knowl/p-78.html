<p>For example, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines abortion as the "termination of a pregnancy after, accompanied by, resulting in, or closely follow by the death of the embryo or fetus" <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/abortion-def-abortion.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 1.12.1">[1.12.1]</a>. However when Catherin Glenn Foster, the President and CEO of Americans United for Life was asked if an abortion occurred in the scenario of a 10-year old rape victim who became pregnant, and terminated the pregnancy, Foster replied that an abortion did not occur because “it would probably impact [the girl’s] life, and so, therefore, it would fall under any exception and would not be an abortion.” Foster later clarified that “If a 10-year old became pregnant as a result of rape and it was threatening her life, then that’s not an abortion”.  <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/abortion-Maddow.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 1.12.8">[1.12.8]</a></p>

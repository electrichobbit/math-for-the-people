<p>To find the probability of not getting arrested in school in Missouri, we know that there are 915,033 total students, and we also know that only 1,487 were arrested. So we know that the rest of the students were not arrested. So, we can subtract the arrested students from the total students to find the not arrested students, which gives us 913,546 students that were not arrested. We then find the ratio of not arrested students to total students: 913,546/915,033=0.998375, or around 99.3875%.</p>

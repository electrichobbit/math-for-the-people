<p>The other side of this coin concerns solutions. Even if people have an accurate view of what the problems are, false information can make it harder to build support for workable solutions. For example, what are the effects of programs designed to reduce poverty? If misleading information is publicized that seems to show particular programs fail, then the public will not support those programs and the poorest members of our community will suffer more. Similarly, if proposed methods of reducing carbon emissions are inaccurately portrayed as failures, then such methods will not be adopted.</p>

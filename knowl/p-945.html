<p>where <span class="process-math">\(end value - start value\)</span> is total change, and dividing by start value gives percent change. Note that end value does not have to be bigger than start value, in which case we have a decrease and not an increase. For example, if the number of arrests went down from 61,812 to 60,170, then the total change would be -1,642, which is a 1,642/61,812=0.0266=2.66% decrease (since <span class="process-math">\(0.0266 \cdot 100=2.66\)</span>). Note that in this case we divided by 61,812 because that was the starting value, and the percent decrease is smaller than the percent increase, because the change of is the same in both cases, while the starting value is different.</p>

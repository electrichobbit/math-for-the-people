<p>This brings us to the question, then, of which groups of people have access to those things.  Although the ECOA banned discrimination in the loaning of money in 1974, access to credit tends to be passed down through generations.  If your grandparents did not have access to credit, they may not have been able to support your parents when they needed to borrow money for education or a first home - in which case, your parents would be unable to offer the same opportunities to you.</p>

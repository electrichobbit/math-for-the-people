<p>CODAP allows you to make both visual and numeric comparisons between variables in a dataset. There are several interesting features in CODAP that can help you learn about data. One of these features is that all representations are linked, meaning that data points can be tracked within different representations. Another feature of CODAP is that you can save your work at benchmarks, meaning that you have a retrievable point in your work. Part of exploring data means making guesses and predictions about trends and patterns you expect to see.</p>

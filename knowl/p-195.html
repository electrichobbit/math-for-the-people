<p>In 1475, in the city of Trent, in what is now Italy, a two-year-old boy named Simon was brutally murdered. The body was found in the cellar of a Jewish family. A rumor quickly spread around town that the Jewish community had murdered the child and used his blood for their religious ceremonies. The local authorities of Trent rounded up Jewish members of the community, tortured them into false confessions, and executed some of them. Representatives from the Roman Catholic Church investigated and found no evidence of the involvement of any of the town’s Jewish community, but the local authorities convicted the community of the crime. Kristeller describes the rise of anti-semitic writing of poems and articles written about the incident that were printed in multiple languages in Europe <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fake-news-biblio-simon-of-trent.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 3.10.1.26">[3.10.1.26]</a>. This spread of Simon’s story reminds us that “fake news” and the use of it to oppress minorities has a long history.</p>

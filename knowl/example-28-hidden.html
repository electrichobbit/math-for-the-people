<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p>In 2015-16, 61,812 students were arrested out of 49,977,268 who were enrolled nationally that year. What percentage of the student population was arrested that year?</p>
<p>We know the part (61,812) and the whole (49,977,268), but not the percent, so</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{61812}{49977268} = percent/100,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>or <span class="process-math">\(0.00124 = percent/100\text{,}\)</span> which means that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
percent = 0.00124 \cdot 100 = 0.124\%,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>so 0.124% of all students were arrested.</p></article></body>

<p>Mathematical models provide a means of capturing how a confluence of variables factor into and effect situations They can also be used to make predictions regarding what is to come.  In this section we examine models that lend insight into global warming and the average global temperature predictions.  We will look at the Green House Effect and explore how to predict temperature increase based on varying amounts (distributions) of certain greenhouse gasses.  The main green house gasses are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.  Each has its own impact on temperature increase dependent on a combination of qualities including lifetime, abundance, and radiative capacity.  Units and other measures are often defined to capture how a confluence of qualities effect a particular inpact.  Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Global Temperature Potential (GTP) are two such examples that will also examine in this section.</p>

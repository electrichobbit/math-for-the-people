<p>To understand what the school-to-prison pipeline is, we need to learn some history of police presence in schools and of strict school discipline policies. We will use ratios, percentages, probability, and data analysis to understand how school discipline has changed over time and how school discipline does not affect all students the same. In this module, we will see that there are certain groups of students that are disproportionately affected by these policies.</p>

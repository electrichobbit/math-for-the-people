<p>From our earlier examples, we know that maximizing representation requires a combination of “packing” and “cracking” strategies with the idea that one party's voters are best utilized through narrow wins and wide losses. The <dfn class="terminology">efficiency gap</dfn> calculation is based on the idea of <em class="emphasis">wasted votes</em>:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>If a party wins a district, any votes for that party above the minimum needed to win are considered “wasted.”</p></li>
<li><p>If a party loses a district, all votes for that party are considered “wasted.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">Following an election, we can determine the total number of wasted votes for each party (across all districts) and calculate the efficiency gap:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\textrm{efficiency gap} = \frac{\textrm{wasted votes for party A } - \textrm{wasted votes for party B}}{\textrm{total votes cast}}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">This formula will produce a value between 0 and 1 and can be converted to an advantage in actual number of representatives through multiplying by the number of districts.</p>

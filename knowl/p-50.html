<p>So, let's take some time to consider this set image. We know that the set of children that deserve to live is a subset of the set of all children. Our goal is to think about if there are any subsets or groups of children that should be excluded from the set of children that deserve to live, but would still be considered part of the set of all children. As an author, I have contemplated the question of if these sets were different for quite a long time, and I continue to come to the conclusion that the sets are the same.</p>

<p>There is another way to think about multiple outcomes, and this happens when the events happen independently. In independent events, two separate events happen that have the same underlying probability, or at least we would like to think that they should (refer to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/safe.html" title="Exploration 8.7.1">ExplorationÂ 8.7.1</a> for more detail). This is the crux of many arguments about school discipline. For an event to be independent, the underlying probability of the event should be the same across all subgroups. Consider an event like being enrolled in the reduced lunch program. If the probability of enrollment is approximately the same for all racial subgroups, then being in the reduced lunch group and the being in racial subgroups are independent. From your experience, do you think this is always the case? Feel free to use any relevant examples.</p>

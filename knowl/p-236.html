<p>Then we discussed how to avoid being tricked by misleading graphs in the news. Just because it’s a graph, it does not mean that the most obvious interpretation of the graph is correct. Always think about what a plausible range for the y-axis and the x-axis should be. Think through whether or not the difference shown is truly meaningful. Ask if there is more data in a trend that is not pictured to assess if change is really occurring or if it’s just a random shift over a year or two or among different groups.</p>

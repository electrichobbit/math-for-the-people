<p>First, create a frequency distribution table, where you will note how many times a particular category has been repeated. For example, question 2 of the "Neighborhood welfare survey" asked the respondents to indicate all the neighbourhood-related issues they were concerned about. The question provided the respondents with nine options. Each option would be considered as a category. Based on the responses, if you find that 200 responses have been collected, and 30 of them indicate lack of a proper waste disposal system, then the corresponding frequency would be 30. Likewise, if 20 out of 200 responses indicate respondents' concern about air pollution, then the corresponding frequency would be 20.</p>

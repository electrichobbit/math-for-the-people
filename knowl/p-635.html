<p>One popular type of bank loan, used by many consumers, is the credit card.  A credit card is effectively an agreement between the bank and the cardholder to loan any amount of money on a short-term basis, up to a certain amount - called the <em class="emphasis">credit limit</em>.  The cardholder agrees to pay back at least the interest on the loan each month, or pay a penalty.  If the cardholder doesn't make their minimum payment each month, in addition to the penalty fees, the bank can cancel the credit card.  Falling behind on paying a credit card can quickly add up - both in fees and in damage to your credit rating.  If you have a high credit score, banks will usually agree to give you a credit card with a low interest rate.  If your credit score isn't as good, though, they will either deny you a card entirely, offer you one with a high interest rate, or require you to secure the card (pay a deposit to cover any missed payments).</p>

<p>The tables below show the results of the North Carolina congressional elections in 2018 (prior to the state ruling that partisan gerrymandering is illegal, forcing a new map to be drawn and used) and 2020. For purposes of calculations, assume that an equal number of people voted in each district. NOTE: Do not include the 100-0 districts in the calculations as candidates ran unopposed, so it does not make sense to say votes are “wasted” when voters did not have a choice on candidates.</p>

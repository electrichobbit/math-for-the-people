<h4 class="heading"><span class="type">Quotation</span></h4>"But sometimes boundaries that look odd at first glance just follow a natural geographic feature, like a river or a mountain range. Or they could be necessary to unite communities that live in different areas but share similar representational needs, like communities of color that have been subject to residential discrimination. Other times, odd boundaries are very much the product of gerrymandering. [...] The reality is that visual inspection can be a helpful, but ultimately very incomplete, analysis. It is a good first test that can help identify where a deeper dive is needed. In other words, donâ€™t judge a book by its cover." <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/gerrymandering-bc-shape.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 4.12.31">[4.12.31]</a>

<p>Letâ€™s say you are conducting a neighborhood welfare survey. The survey aims to learn about the different issues the residents are concerned about and want the local authorities to address immediately. The survey contains a combination of ten closed and open-ended questions. For details about the survey, see \vref{pictureX}. Overall, the survey questions collected two types of data: non-numeric (Questions 1, 2, 5, 6, 9) and numeric (Questions 3, 4, 7, 8, 10), based on which the data can be broadly classified into two types: categorical data and quantitative data.</p>

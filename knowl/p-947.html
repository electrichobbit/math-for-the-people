<p>We have two main ways that we think about probability. One is what is called a theoretical model.  In the theoretical model, probabilities are driven by expectations of what we know. One classical example of a theoretical model is a coin flip where we know that there are two specific outcomes, or thinking about the months of the year from the probability scale. The second model is called an empirical model, and it is based on directly counting the occurrences of outcomes from events that have occurred. The empirical model is useful when the event being studied does not happen regularly. The process of selecting objects to model a process is called a probability experiment. A probability experiment offers a way to explore different outcomes. We can manually calculate the outcomes of a probability experiment, or use a tool like a simulator to help us understand a situation that is represented in a statement. Our choice to do this depends on the outcome or event that we might be looking at.</p>

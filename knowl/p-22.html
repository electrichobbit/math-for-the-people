<p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court sided with Dobbs, who was the head of the Mississippi Health Department in 2018. This decision is based on the idea that access to abortion is not a constitutional right because, in fact, there is no inherent right to privacy or personal autonomy in the Constitution. Now that precedent has been set that there is no constitutional right to privacy, many other U.S Supreme Court cases are subject to be re-examined that could result in a major set-back to the civil rights movement. These include, but certainly not limited to, legality of same-sex marriages, inter-racial marriages, and contraception.</p>

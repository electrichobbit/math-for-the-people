<p>Each district has 9 voters, so the minimum number of votes needed to win is 5. Any votes over 5 for the winning party (in that district) are considered “wasted” votes for that party. In District 1, the Heart party wins with 6 votes, thus the Heart party has 1 wasted vote in that district. All votes for the losing party in a district are classified as wasted votes, so the Club party has 3 wasted votes in District 1. In District 2, Club wins with exactly 5 votes, so Club party has no wasted votes. Heart party, then, has 4 wasted votes. The computations for the other districts are done in the same manner.</p>
<p>To compute the efficiency gap, find the total wasted votes for each party, then use the formula given above. Since the Club party has fewer wasted votes, we calculate the efficiency gap from their perspective (subtracting their wasted votes from the other party's in the formula):</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\textrm{efficiency gap} = \frac{\textrm{wasted votes for } \heartsuit - \textrm{wasted votes for }\clubsuit }{\textrm{total votes cast}} = \frac{(11 - 9)}{45} \approx 4 \%.
\end{equation*}

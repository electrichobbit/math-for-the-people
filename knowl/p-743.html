<p>In practice, when we look at two sets of data, the relationship between them is rarely this exact.  For example, look at these two sets of data:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
{1,2,5,6,12}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
{2,5,9,14,21}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">The values in the second set are just a little bit off from two times as much as the first set.  If someone told you the next number in the first set was 30, though, you would still probably expect the next number in the second set to be approximately 60 - maybe not exactly 60, but something close.  Even though one number doesn't exactly predict the other, it comes pretty close.</p>

<p>If you play the game just once, you'll end up either $1 richer or $1 poorer - there's a 50% chance of either.  If you play it twice, you either win both, win the first and lose the second, lose the first and win the second, or lose both - so there are 4 possibilities.  If you win both times, you're $2 richer.  If you win one and lose one (either of the middle two situations) you're back where you started - $0 richer.  If you lose both, you're $2 poorer.  If you average out the different scenarios, you end up exactly where you started - there's exactly the same chance of winning money as losing.  So we say the expected value is $0 - on average, we don't expect to end up with any more money than we started with.</p>

<p>Payday loans are a type of loan often called a "loan of last resort." Anyone can take out a payday loan - the lender does not check their credit score to determine risk.  Therefore, the lender must assume that everyone taking out a payday loan is high risk - even though that may not be true.  Payday loans are generally made for a short term, usually two weeks (the name comes from taking a loan until the next payday, when it can be paid back). At the end of the two weeks, the borrower must pay back the amount they borrowed plus a fee.  Payday loans are usually for small amounts - up to $1000 - and charge a fee of $10-$30 for each $100 borrowed [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-payday-loan-cfpb.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 6.11.1.98: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: What is a Payday Loan">[6.11.1.98]</a>].  So you might borrow $200 and pay it back two weeks later, plus a $30 fee.  While this may not seem like much, this is equivalent to an annual interest rate of 360% - almost 20 times what a credit card might charge!

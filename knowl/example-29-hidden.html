<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p>There were 60,170 school arrests in 2013-14 school year, and 61,812 arrests in 2015-16. The total change in the number of school arrests between these two years is 61,812-60,170=1,642. To know what percent increase this is, we need to compare to the original number, in this case 60,170:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
1,642/60,170=0.027.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We convert a decimal to percent by multiplying by 100: since <span class="process-math">\(part/whole = percent/100\text{,}\)</span> it means that <span class="process-math">\(percent = part/whole \cdot 100\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, 0.027= 2.72%, so the number of arrests went up by 2.72%.</p>
<p>More generally, the formula for percent change from old value to new value is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{end value - start value}{start value},
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where <span class="process-math">\(end value - start value\)</span> is total change, and dividing by start value gives percent change. Note that end value does not have to be bigger than start value, in which case we have a decrease and not an increase. For example, if the number of arrests went down from 61,812 to 60,170, then the total change would be -1,642, which is a 1,642/61,812=0.0266=2.66% decrease (since <span class="process-math">\(0.0266 \cdot 100=2.66\)</span>). Note that in this case we divided by 61,812 because that was the starting value, and the percent decrease is smaller than the percent increase, because the change of is the same in both cases, while the starting value is different.</p></article></body>

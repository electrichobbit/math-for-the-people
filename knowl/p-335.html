<p><dfn class="terminology">Why is this result not controversial?</dfn> Republicans do exist in Massachusetts and regularly receive between 30 and 40 percent of the vote in statewide elections (President, Governor, Senate). Proportional representation would give Republicans 3 of the 9 congressional districts; however, even though the possible number of valid districting plans exceeds the number of particles in the universe, it is impossible to come up a plan that yields even one Republican district! <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/gerrymandering-gerrymandering-Mass-MGGG.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 4.12.35">[4.12.35]</a> This is simply due to the geography and the fact that there are no large Republican enclaves within the state. Due to the natural distribution of their voters, <em class="emphasis">they do not form a majority in any region of Massachusetts</em>, leading to their prolonged lack of representation in Congress.</p>

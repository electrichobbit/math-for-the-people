<p>But because graphs appear to show objective truth, some people try to abuse that trust people have in graphed data to make things appear differently than they are. As a simple image, such graphs are easily shared online, sometimes with a caption indicating what the viewer is expected to believe as a result. There is a variety of ways to manipulate graphs, we’ll look at two. First, we’ll talk about truncating the y-axis. How wide of a range should you show on the y-axis? What should be the lowest value and what should be the highest? The question is: the y-axis range should go from what to what? In the case of counting things, you might expect the y-axis to range from zero to some plausible number for the most extreme case. But if you wanted to make something look like it was changing more over time you might include a smaller range in the y-axis, which we call truncating the y-axis.</p>

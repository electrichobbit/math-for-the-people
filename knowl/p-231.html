<p>But some of you may have also started wondering about the x-axis. Where’s the data for 2017, 2018, and 2019? The F.B.I. had data for those years for murders in the last graph, where are they for robberies? That gets to the other side of manipulating graphs. Just like you can shrink the range of the y-axis, you can pick whatever range you want for the x-axis. Sometimes people call that “cherry-picking” the data. You only show the data in a graph that supports an argument you want to make and you exclude the data you want to hide. Once again, we’re looking at shady methods of trying to manipulate people. Take a look at <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fake-news-misleading-graphs-figure-robberies-corrected-expanded.html" title="Figure 3.6.6">Figure 3.6.6</a>, which shows the same graph as <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fake-news-misleading-graphs-figure-robberies-corrected.html" title="Figure 3.6.5">Figure 3.6.5</a>, but includes the later years from the report <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fake-news-biblio-fbi.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 3.10.1.24">[3.10.1.24]</a>.</p>

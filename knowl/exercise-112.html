<p>You are applying for a loan from a bank that charges 8% interest, compounded monthly.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>If you pay the loan off in one lump sum after 2 years, how much will you owe?</p></li>
<li><p>The bank believes, based on your credit score, that there is a 5% chance that you will not pay back the loan (called a default).  Using your answer from the previous question, calculate the expected value of the loan for the bank.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the last problem, but this time assume that there is a 20% chance that you will not pay back the loan.  What is the expected value for the bank now?</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the previous question, but this time assume that the bank charges 15% interest.  How much money do you owe after 2 years? What is the expected value for the bank if there is a 20% chance that you will not pay back the loan?</p></li>
<li><p>Do these calculations justify why the bank charges higher interest rates for some people than others? Explain why you gave your answer.</p></li>

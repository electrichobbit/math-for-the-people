<p>On the surface, payday loans are available to anyone.  Because wealthier and white households tend to have access to other forms of credit, payday loans tend to be used primarily by poorer households and people of color.  People who do not own their own home are 57% more likely to use payday loans than homeowners.  People without a 4-year college degree are 82% more likely to use payday loans than those with degrees.  Race, though, was the greatest predictor of whether someone had used a payday loan - Blacks were more than twice as likely (105% more likely) to have used a payday loan as individuals of other races and ethnicities, even after controlling for other factors like income level and homeownership <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-race-and-payday-lending.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 6.11.1.103">[6.11.1.103]</a>.  If access to credit were only determined by risk - factors like income and access to security - we could expect the percentage of white and Black borrowers to be similar.</p>

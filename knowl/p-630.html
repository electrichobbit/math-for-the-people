<p>Credit scores are determined by mathematical algorithms, and are based on many different factors.  We'll look at how they're determined in <a href="payday-loans-risk.html" class="internal" title="Section 6.6: Risk and Credit Scores">SectionÂ 6.6</a>.  The general principle of credit scores is that you are more likely to repay a loan if you have repaid other loans in the past.  While this may seem like a reasonable system at face-value, it can create huge problems for people who haven't had access to loans in the past.</p>

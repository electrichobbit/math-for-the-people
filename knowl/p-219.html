<p>Coincidence or randomness – one thing that happens (“I was assaulted in the park so this must be a high crime neighborhood”) or two things that happen around the same time (“my friend was assaulted in the same park the same week”) may constitute coincidence or randomness but not real information. Something similar can be said for a researcher or policy expert who reports results from an analysis or experiment that has not been repeated or validated by others.</p>

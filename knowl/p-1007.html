<p>One tool that is used to model and understand probability is simulation. In this part of the module, we will be using a simulation to help us explore different probability scenarios to see which behaves most like our target. We can determine if information from an empirical model provides a stable foundation for a theoretical model, meaning it can be replicated or nearly replicated over a number of trials. We can also use a theoretical model to produce simulated samples which can let us know if different empirical models are valid. In this exploration, you will examine a data table that shows the overall population for men's prisons by race <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-BJS-report.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.132">[8.12.132]</a>. Then you will examine three different simulations to see which one you think would be most likely to produce the prison population given.  In reading the output from the simulations, there is an overall summary column presented at the left, which shows the mean proportion for each race for all of the trials. In the center, there are the summaries from each trial, meaning it shows the proportion for each race in each trial. Then in the far right hand column, the raw data is shown. The simulations model the selection of 50 individual prisoners in 25 repeated samples. The variable being simulated is prisoner race because that is what we are interested in modeling. Before you start working with the simulations (where you only need to select “start” to collect data), think about strategies that you can use to see if you think a model will match.</p>

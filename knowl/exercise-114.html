<p>The file <a class="external" href="payday-lending/Data_Files/Alabama_Payday.csv" target="_blank">Alabama_Payday.csv</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-99-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.10.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> contains the data we looked at in <a href="payday-loans-solving-for-change.html" class="internal" title="Section 6.8: Solving for Change">Section 6.8</a>, but with two more columns - the population of each county and the number of payday lenders per 100,000 people in each county. In the chapter, we discussed the possibility that our correlation between payday lenders and larger Black populations might actually be a correlation between larger counties and larger Black populations, since we would expect larger counties to have more payday lenders.  Computing a figure per 100,000 people in an area is a common way to compare statistics in areas of differing populations.</p>
<p>Calculate the correlation to see if larger counties do have more payday lenders.  Then calculate the correlation between the number of payday lenders per 100,000 people and the percentage of each race in that county to see if there is still a correlation after we adjust for population. You can use the code window below, a spreadsheet program, or your calculator.</p>

<p>The most common way that states have "banned" payday loans is by prohibiting annual percentage rates above a certain level, usually 36%.  Consider a payday loan of $400, where the loan is due back plus a payment of $40 in two weeks.

Remember that your time needs to be converted to years!</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="payday-loans-exercises.html#exercise-99" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

<p>The idea of using carbon footprints to reduce emissions is that if everyone were aware of how much carbon they used, and made small changes, then our overall carbon use would go down.  For example, livestock - animals raised for meat and other food products like milk - are estimated to make up 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/greenhouse-gas-biblio-livestock.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 5.11.1.82">[5.11.1.82]</a>.  Therefore, if everyone in the world switched to a vegan diet, those emissions would be reduced - though not eliminated, since they would be replaced by the emissions necessary to feed everyone a vegan diet instead.</p>

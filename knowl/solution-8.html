<p>In the first scenario, when 45 of the White voters voted for the Heart candidate, we had 10 White voters vote for the Club candidate (since the total number of White voters is 55). Furthermore, since there are 60 total Heart voters and 45 of them are White voters, we must have <span class="process-math">\(60 - 45 = 15 \)</span> non-White Heart voters. To complete the second row of data, note that we now have 15 non-White voters who voted for the Heart candidate and 45 total non-White voters, so we must have <span class="process-math">\(45 - 15 = 30\)</span> non-White voters who chose the Club candidate.</p>
<p>In the second scenario, we have 30 of the White voters choosing the Heart candidate. Thus we have <span class="process-math">\(55 - 30 = 25\)</span> White Club voters (total White voters - White Heart voters = White Club voters). Similarly, since there are 60 total Heart voters and 30 of them are White voters, we must have <span class="process-math">\(60 - 30 = 30 \)</span> non-White Heart voters. To complete the second row of data, note that we now have 30 non-White voters who voted for the Heart candidate and 45 total non-White voters, so we must have <span class="process-math">\(45 - 30 = 15\)</span> non-White voters who voted for the Club candidate.</p>

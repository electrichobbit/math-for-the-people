<p>The <dfn class="terminology">mean-median difference</dfn> takes a statistical approach to measuring partisan advantage. If there was a lot of packing and cracking in a map, we would expect to see one party win many districts with just over 50% of the votes and lose a few districts with a small share of the votes. If we looked at the collection of these vote shares of districts as a set of data, we would expect the median to be higher than the mean. This skewness represents an advantage for that political party.</p>

<p>The file <a class="external" href="payday-lending/Data_Files/county-lender-data.csv" target="_blank">county-lender-data.csv</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-100-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.10.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> contains data similar to what we looked at in the previous problem, but for every county in the United States of America (all data is from the 2021 County Business Patterns (CBP) and 2021 American Community Survey (ACS) of the US Census <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-census.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 6.11.1.111: United States Census CEDSCI.">[6.11.1.111]</a>).  This file contains:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>County Name</p></li>
<li><p>State Name</p></li>
<li><p>The number of payday lenders or similar businesses (more accurately, these are businesses classified as NAICS code 522390 <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-payday-lending-naics-522390.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 6.11.1.115: 522390 - Other Activities Related to Credit Intermediation">[6.11.1.115]</a>, which includes check-cashing and money-wiring services, in addition to payday lending) in that county.</p></li>
<li><p>The population of the county.</p></li>
<li><p>The percentage of the county which is white.</p></li>
<li><p>The percentage of the county which is Black.</p></li>
<li><p>The percentage of the county who identify as Hispanic (note that as this is a cultural identity, individuals who identify as Hispanic can be white, Black, or neither).</p></li>
<li><p>The median household income in the county.</p></li>
<li><p>The percentage of people in the county over age 18 who have a high school diploma (or equivalent) or higher degree.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of payday lenders (NAICS code 522390) per 100,000 people in each county.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Choose a state to examine.  Using the code window below, a calculator, or a spreadsheet program, calculate the correlation between the number of payday lenders and population, percentage white, percentage Black, percentage Hispanic, median income, and percentage of people with a high school diploma or equivalent.  Which of these correlations are strongest for your state? Which are weakest? Explain what this tells you about where payday lenders are located.</p>
<p>Now repeat the exercise above, but use the number of payday lenders per 100,000 people.  Which correlations are strongest for your state? Which are weakest? Explain what this tells you about where payday lenders are located.  Why is this more useful than what you uncovered above?</p>

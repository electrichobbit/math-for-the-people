<p>The Supreme Court's ruling in Row v Wade on January 22, 1973, gave people in the United States legal access to abortion across the United States. The ruling was based on the right to privacy which is protected by the 14th Amendment. Since this ruling, there have been numerous attempts to overturn the Supreme Court's 1973 decision.</p>

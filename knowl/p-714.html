<p>Once banks determine how likely you are to repay a loan, they can make a decision about whether they will loan you money, whether that's as a student loan, credit card, or something else.  They use the credit score to determine the amount of money they can expect to make off of the loan.  If you don't repay the loan, they will lose all of the money that they loaned you.  If you do repay the loan, then they make money - in the form of the interest that you pay back on the loan.  This is called the <em class="emphasis">expected value</em> of the loan.  It depends on both the probability that a borrower will pay back the loan, the amount of money being borrowed, and the amount of interest that the bank will make off of the loan.</p>

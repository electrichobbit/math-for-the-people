<p>While human beings are unlikely to go extinct - our intelligence has made us more adaptable than other species - climate change has already begun to affect our species.  Research has shown that production of the 10 largest crops in the world has already dropped by 1% since 1974 below where it would be without the impact of climate change <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/greenhouse-gas-biblio-crops.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 5.11.1.69">[5.11.1.69]</a>.  The United Nations High Commission on Refugees estimates that between 2008 and 2019, there were over 21.5 million displacements of people - when an individual was forced to flee their home - caused by weather-related events, more than twice as many as those caused by conflicts or violence <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/greenhouse-gas-biblio-refugees.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 5.11.1.70">[5.11.1.70]</a>.   The same data shows that climate disasters like droughts, cyclones, and floods can have destabilizing effects on countries, especially those already experiencing conflict, like Afghanistan, Yemen, and Mozambique.</p>

<p>President Biden's loan forgiveness program involves an ``income cap'', which means that the program only applies to individuals who earn below <span class="process-math">\(\$125,000\)</span> or households who earn below <span class="process-math">\(\$250,000\)</span> each year. According to the Wharton analysis shown in Table <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/pennwhartonbudgetmodelBidenStudentLoan2022.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 9.11.169: The Biden Student Loan Forgiveness Plan: Budgetary Costs and Distributional Impact">[9.11.169]</a>, whether or not an income cap is applied, the most loan forgiveness would go to households earning between <span class="process-math">\(\$51,000\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\$82,000\)</span> a year.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>What income percentile(s) in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/student-loans-table-debt-forgiven-by-income.html" title="Table 9.8.1: Student Loan Debt Forgiven by Income Level">TableÂ 9.8.1</a> do these earners belong to?</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming that the loan forgiveness policy stays constant for the next <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> years, estimate the percentage of loan forgiveness that will apply to these income percentile(s). Make the simplifying assumption that all student loan borrowers are individuals and not households.</p></li>
<li><p>Does the Wharton estimate make sense? Why or why not?</p></li>

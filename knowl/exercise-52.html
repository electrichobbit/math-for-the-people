<p>There is an alternative “shortcut” formula to calculate the efficiency gap in a districting plan:</p>
<p>Efficiency Gap = (% of Districts won <span class="process-math">\(-\)</span> 50%) <span class="process-math">\(-\)</span> 2 * (% of Votes <span class="process-math">\(-\)</span> 50%)</p>
<p>For example, in the district plan in Example 1.6.1 (given in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/gerrymandering-efficiency-gap-example-district-plan.html" title="Table 4.6.2">Table 4.6.2</a>), Heart wins 3/5 = 60% of districts and has 26/45 = 57.8% of voters.</p>
<p>Using the formula: Efficiency Gap = (60% <span class="process-math">\(-\)</span> 50%) <span class="process-math">\(-\)</span> 2 * (57.8% <span class="process-math">\(-\)</span> 50%) = <span class="process-math">\(-5.6\)</span>%. Since we used values for Heart, the negative number here represents that the Club party holds the advantage in this map.</p>
<p><em class="emphasis">Note:</em> This answer is slightly different from the original calculation due to rounding error and the fact that our grid districts needed at least 5/9 = 55.6% of voters to win (rather than 50% +1 vote).</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Use this alternative formula to calculate and interpret the efficiency gap in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/gerrymandering-first-efficiency-gap-exercise.html" title="Exercise 4.11.11: Efficiency Gap">Exercise 4.11.11</a>. Are your answers close?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose a party has 60% of votes on an entire map. The “most fair” outcome according to the efficiency gap formula is that this party wins what percentage of districts? What does your answer tell you about the efficiency gap formula and proportionality?</p></li>

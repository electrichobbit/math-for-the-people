<p>Each district has 9 voters, so the minimum number of votes needed to win is 5. Any votes over 5 for the winning party (in that district) are considered “wasted” votes for that party. In District 1, the Heart party wins with 6 votes, thus the Heart party has 1 wasted vote in that district. All votes for the losing party in a district are classified as wasted votes, so the Club party has 3 wasted votes in District 1. In District 2, Club wins with exactly 5 votes, so Club party has no wasted votes. Heart party, then, has 4 wasted votes. The computations for the other districts are done in the same manner.</p>

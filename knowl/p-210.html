<p>Now suppose I want to calculate the volume of the cylindrical fiberglass water reclamation tank I am staring at in my backyard as I write this. The equation for the volume of a cylindrical object is area of the base x height = volume and area of a circle is <span class="process-math">\(\pi r^2\)</span> = Area. In this case, I have to make two measurements, height and diameter (diameter is twice the radius represented as r in the equation). I can measure the height with a tape measure, although that tank has been sitting there for 15 years so I’m not sure how much of bottom is under the gravel surrounding it. I can “back-calculate” the radius by measuring the circumference with the tape measure.</p>

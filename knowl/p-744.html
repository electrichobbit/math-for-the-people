<p>The correlation is a way of measuring how closely one set of numbers predict another.  The correlation gives a number between 1 and -1.  A correlation of 0 means that there is absolutely no relationship between the two sets of numbers - when one changes, you can't predict what will happen to the other.  A correlation of 1 means that there is a perfect relationship between the numbers - when the values in the first data set increase, the values in the second data set increases in a way that exactly corresponds.  Our first two sets of numbers would have a correlation of 1.  Our second pair would have a correlation close to 1, but not exactly 1.  A correlation of -1 also indicates a perfect relationship, but when one of the values in one set increases, the values in the second set will <em class="emphasis">decrease</em> in a way that exactly corresponds.  So the pattern is still perfect, but it works in reverse.</p>

<p>In the absence of payday lenders, financial institutions like credit unions can fill the gap.  Many credit unions, which are non-profits, offer payday alternative loans to their members.  These loans function much like payday loans, but with interest rates that are much more reasonable.  Removing bad actors like payday lenders creates more space for financial services like these to be successul in our communities.</p>

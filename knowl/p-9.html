<p>That's ok.  Education, fundamentally, is about challenging what you already know and learning about new things.  You may find, through your research and work in this class, that your views don't change.  You may find that they do. Our goal, in Math for the People, is to present factual information and to teach you the quantitative tools you need to understand that information.  We encourage you to look at other data, work through your own examples, and see how it agrees or disagrees with what is presented in the text.  While we do not hesitate to present our own viewpoint, which we believe is supported by the quantitative data, these are complicated problems and there may be other solutions we're not considering.</p>

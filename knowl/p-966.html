<p>Following up: Based on models we have looked at, we realize that being Black and getting suspended can happen together, so those events are not mutually exclusive. When I know that being truant means not attending school regularly, I realize that the events in Event pair B are complements and have to be mutually exclusive. Event pair C is the most difficult to really take apart. Common sense-wise and experience-wise it seems like maybe the people who got good grades didn’t get in real trouble at school, but then again there is no reason why they couldn’t get into trouble. This means that they have to be not mutually exclusive events.</p>

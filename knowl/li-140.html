<p>Next, calculate the first and third quartile. Values that divide a data set into four equal parts (quarters) are called <dfn class="terminology">quartiles</dfn>.</p>
<p>The <dfn class="terminology">first quartile</dfn> or the <dfn class="terminology">lower quartile (<span class="process-math">\(Q_1\)</span>)</dfn> is the data point below which 25% of the data points, and above which 75% of the data points are located. If the first quartile of the annual household income data is $31,000, then 25% of the respondents' annual household income is less than and 75% of the respondents' annual household income is more than$31,000.</p>
<p>The <dfn class="terminology">third quartile</dfn> or the <dfn class="terminology">upper quartile (<span class="process-math">\(Q_3\)</span>)</dfn> is the data point below which 75% of the data points, and above which 25% of the data points are located. If the third quartile of the annual household income data is $40,000, then 75% of the respondents' annual household income is less than and 25% of the respondents' annual household income is more than$40,000.</p>

<p>An <dfn class="terminology">outlier</dfn> is an observation (data point), which is either too high or too low compared to the rest of the data points in a data set. For example, in the annual household income data set, the annual household income of $55,000 is an outlier. That means, the respondent having an annual household income of $55,000 is earning considerably high compared to the rest of the respondents who filled the survey.</p>
<p>The rule that is followed to identify an outlier in a given data set is called 1.5 x IQR. When a data set is given,</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>First find its median, upper quartile, and the lower quartile.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, calculate the value of interquartile range <span class="process-math">\((Q_3-Q_1)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Calculate 1.5 x IQR = 1.5 x <span class="process-math">\((Q_3-Q_1)\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>Find the fences:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\text{Upper fence: }Q_3 + 1.5 * (Q_3-Q_1)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\text{Lower fence: }Q_1 - 1.5 * (Q_3-Q_1)
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Any data point beyond the fences, that is either lower than the lower fence or higher than the upper fence is an outlier.</p></li>

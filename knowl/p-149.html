<p>The important thing to know about a bar graph is that the longer/ taller the bars are, the greater the values they represent. That means, in the given bar chart, since the height of the bar representing “Access to healthy drinking water” is the highest, you can conclude that most of the respondents, twenty to be precise, said that they were concerned about healthy drinking water. Likewise, the height of the “Risk of flooding/ forest fire” bar suggests that minimum number of respondents, two to be precise, said that they were concerned about flooding or forest fire.</p>

The forecasts for global climate change and its consequences involve some of the most sophisticated measurements and computer modeling humanity has ever devised. While it might seem overwhelming to consider the error in each of the measurements and how they are propagated, you can take comfort in the fact that thousands of researchers around the world are arriving at similar conclusions.

<p>This topic may be new to you, and it also may be one that personally affects you. In this module we are primarily focusing on two aspects of the school-to-prison pipeline: school discipline (such as suspensions) and the presence of police in schools. If you have personal experiences with school discipline and police in schools, please engage with this module at your own pace and comfort level. If you know little or nothing about these topics, the following sections will provide you with more information about the problem.</p>

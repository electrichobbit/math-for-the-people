<p>Suppose we collected data from all precincts from the scenarios in the previous exercise, then created a scatterplot and found the line of best fit.</p>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>
<p>We obtain the following regression line equation for the relationship between White voters and Heart voters among precincts in a district:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\text{(\% of votes for Heart) } = 0.34 \text{ (\% of voters who are White) } + 39
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Using the equation above, what percentage of votes would you predict that Heart would receive from a precinct with all White voters?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<p>We obtain the following regression line equation for the relationship between Hispanic voters and Heart voters among precincts in a district:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\text{(\% of votes for Heart) } = -0.23 \text{ (\% of voters who are Hispanic) } + 57
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Using the equation above, what percentage of votes would you predict that Heart would receive from a precinct with all Hispanic voters?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<p>Do the answers above suggest racially polarized voting among White and Hispanic voters in this particular district? Explain.</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="gerrymandering-exercises.html#exercise-56" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

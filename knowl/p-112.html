<p>Louisiana is one of the highest producers of hazardous waste materials in the United States <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/environmental-racism-biblio-cradle.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 2.10.1.10">[2.10.1.10]</a>. Every year, the chemical factories located in the state, especially on the cancer alley releases vast amount of carbon-dioxide and millions of pounds of poisonous chemicals, thus jeopardizing the health of the residents and the people working in the chemical facilities <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/environmental-racism-biblio-lived-experience.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 2.10.1.20">[2.10.1.20]</a>. The toxic chemicals do not only pollute the air, but unsustainable waste disposal systems, chemical release from factories, and seepage of fertilizers and pesticides from agricultural production also contaminate drinking water. A study by Gottlieb, Carr, and Morris <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/environmental-racism-biblio-cancer-and-water.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 2.10.1.15">[2.10.1.15]</a> reported that the residents of cancer alley, who get their drinking water from Mississippi river are 2.1 times more susceptible to rectal cancer compared to those who depends on an alternate source for their drinking water. Apart from cancer, skin inflammation, significant respiratory problems, and a range of other health threats have also been predominant among the people living in the cancer alley <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/environmental-racism-biblio-diamond.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 2.10.1.17">[2.10.1.17]</a>.</p>

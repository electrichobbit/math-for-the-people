<p>The ability of that O-ring to hold up during the near-freezing temperatures during launch was an uncertainty which had propagated through to the launch event. It may have been the neglect of the NASA engineering team to think through all of the components and how they might fare under adverse conditions. It may have been that the launch team made a fatal assumption “in the moment” that the O-ring would remain stable enough. Whatever the deeper explanation, uncertainty surrounding that O-ring’s behavior at those temperatures led to a catastrophe. Uncertainty analysis, which is also more broadly categorized as risk assessment, is designed to flag such issues, especially for enormously complex engineering systems like a spaceship.</p>

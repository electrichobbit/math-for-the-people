<p>The earth's climate is constantly changing, with periods of warming and cooling alternating throughout history and prehistory. Scientists are able to measure the earth's climate by using temperature records for the last roughly 150 years, and using reconstruction from ice cores and seafloor cores before that.  There are many factors that cause the earth's climate to change, including changes in the sun, changes in the tilt of the earth's axis, meteorites, volcanos, and changes in vegetation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/greenhouse-gas-biblio-causes-of-climate-change.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 5.11.1.60">[5.11.1.60]</a>.  Some of these changes, like changes in the sun or the tilt of the earth's axis, happen slowly over millions of years and cause similarly slow changes in climate.</p>

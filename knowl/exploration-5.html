<p>Examine the following table with data for the school support staff in the Washington DC school district <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-ACLU-report.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.129">[8.12.129]</a>.</p>

\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \text{Counselors} \amp \text{Social Workers} \amp \text{Psychologists} \amp \text{Nurses} \amp \text{Law Enforcement} \amp \text{Security Guards} \\ \hline 235 \amp 223 \amp 198 \amp 154 \amp 154 \amp 333 \\\hline \end{array}

<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Look at the numbers for the groups and make comparisons between them. Are there any exact ratios, meaning any comparisons between groups that are identical or can be combined to be identical?</p></li>
<li><p>Thinking about probability, which type of support staff has the highest probability? Which type of support staff has the lowest probability?</p></li>
<li><p>Critical thinking: How does the ratio of (Law Enforcement + Security Guards):(Counselors + Social Workers + Psychologists + Nurses) look? Why would we be interested in this ratio? Were you expecting it to be closer together or further apart? How does this help you think about the school-to-prison pipeline?</p></li>
<li><p>Critical Thinking: Building on the idea from the previous question, what groups of support staff do students have the highest probability of encountering? How does this help you think about the school-to-prison pipeline?</p></li>

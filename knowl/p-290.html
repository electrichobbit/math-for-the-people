<p>In these three measures, compactness is a geometric measure that compares the area of a district to some “ideal” compact shape. In each case we consider, the compactness score is a number between 0 and 1 that measures the compactness of the shape relative to the ideal. Districts close in shape to the ideal shape (more compact) have scores closer to 1, while those less compact (farther from the ideal) score closer to 0. When a district has much greater perimeter than we would expect for the region's area (as happens when the shape has long, skinny pieces branching off or strung together), we may suspect gerrymandering. At this time, 37 states include a compactness requirement for state legislative districts, and 18 establish similar requirements for congressional districts. However, there is no universal measure, and different states have different laws that regulate compactness. In Idaho the redistricting commission is expected to “avoid drawing distorted boundaries” <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/gerrymandering-idaho-law.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 4.12.40">[4.12.40]</a>, while in other states with extensive coastlines (such as Maryland) this is impossible. In fact, most states do not provide details on compactness measures but adopt a  “you know it when you see it” approach in determinations.</p>

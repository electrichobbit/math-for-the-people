<p>When we see a correlation like this, as we discussed before, we need to remember that it's not proof of a cause - just evidence.  One thing we should always be thinking about is the possibility of <em class="emphasis">confounding</em>.  Confounding is when another factor we're not thinking about causes a change in our data.  For example, here, poverty could be a confounding factor.  Because of the deep legacy of racial inequality in the United States, Black people are more likely to live in poverty.  Could the correlation between counties with higher Black populations and payday lenders actually be because those counties are poorer?  Let's look and see if there is a correlation between median income and the number of payday lenders.</p>

<p>Strict school discipline is supposed to make parents feel safer sending their children to school, and it is also supposed to make the classroom environment more conducive to learning, with fewer distractions. Families of students who are not being disciplined might welcome, for example, presence of police in schools or zero tolerance policies. It could also be argued that teachers and administrators can benefit from not having to spend time and energy on students they view as disruptive. Finally, mass incarceration has been shown to be profitable, so the prison-industrial complex benefits as well.</p>

<p>An assumption can sometimes be indicated by the presence of words like let, suppose, and assume in regular speech and writing. This particular type of language invites a listener or reader to engage with the possibilities that follow from an initial claim that is assumed to be true.It is important to be aware that not all assumptions are true. For social issues this is especially true. Assuming that certain parts of an argument are true, without proper investigation or consideration, can lead to false conclusions. One example of an assumption that can lead to false conclusions is using a non-shared definition.</p>

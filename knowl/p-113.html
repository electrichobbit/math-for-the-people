<p>Although the cancer is highly predominant among all the people residing in the Cancer Alley, African American people bear a disproportionate burden of cancer mortality compared to the other racial counterparts. Between 1995 and 2006, while the cancer mortality rate of the white men and women were 250 and 167 per 100,000 population, the mortality rate of African American men and women were 395 and 214 per 100,000 population respectively <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/environmental-racism-biblio-cancer-alley.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 2.10.1.14">[2.10.1.14]</a>. One of the reasons behind this glaring difference in the cancer mortality rate is probably because most of the chemical factories and hazardous waste sites on the Cancer Alley are established in areas which are heavily resided by impoverished, people of color. According to Castellón <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/environmental-racism-biblio-cancer-alley.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 2.10.1.14">[2.10.1.14]</a> “there is little evidence that communities of color move to sites where toxic waste facilities and landfills are located. Rather, toxic waste sites are often sited in primarily poor and African American neighborhoods” <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/environmental-racism-biblio-cancer-alley.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 2.10.1.14">[2.10.1.14]</a>. While affluent white communities are often able to "leverage their economic and political clout" to prevent establishment of unwanted facilities in their neighborhoods <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/environmental-racism-biblio-blackmail.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 2.10.1.13">[2.10.1.13]</a>, lack of political support and money, disable people of color to relocate or afford legal representations to fight big industrial facilities moving to their localities <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/environmental-racism-biblio-cancer-alley.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 2.10.1.14">[2.10.1.14]</a>. Such disproportionate burden of environmental harms on a particular socio-economic and racial group is called environmental racism <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/environmental-racism-biblio-dumping.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 2.10.1.12">[2.10.1.12]</a></p>

<p>Let's look at how much money payday lenders are making on loans, through the lens of expected value.  In 2015, the Center for Responsible Lending (CRL) found that 46% of all payday loan borrowers <em class="emphasis">defaulted</em> on their loans within two years <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-crl-defaults.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 6.11.1.112: Payday Mayday:Visible and Invisible Payday Lending Defaults">[6.11.1.112]</a>.  A default on a loan occurs when the lender is unable to meet the terms of the loan. While this doesn't necessarily mean that they didn't pay the loan back (in fact, the CRL found that 66% of those defaulting eventually paid their loans back in full, plus any fees that they would have paid for defaulting, like late fees), it does mean that the lender is losing some money on the investment.  The same study found that 20% of loans are <em class="emphasis">charged off</em> within two years, meaning that the lender gives up on collecting the debt. Again, this doesn't mean they lose all of their money, since the loans are then usually sold to a debt collector who tries to collect some or all of the money, but they do lose much of their investment in this case.</p>

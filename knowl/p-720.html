<p>Let's look at an example of how this works, using insurance as an example.  When an insurance company sells you insurance, they calculate the probability that you will use it - and how much they'll have to pay you if you do use it.  If you don't use the insurance, they "win" the amount of money that you pay for the insurance - if you do use it, they lose whatever they have to pay out for the claim (minus whatever you paid them).  On average, over lots and lots of customers, they'll earn the expected value from each customer. Let's look at an example.</p>

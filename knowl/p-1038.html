<p>The highest proportion of student loan debt (the amount of debt held per student) is held by students at for-profit colleges <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/benmillerOpinionStudentDebt2018.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 9.11.145: Opinion | The Student Debt Problem is Worse than We Imagined">[9.11.145]</a>, which are colleges that are not funded by taxes but instead depend on federal student aid (guaranteed by the government) and the tuition dollars that students pay to attend, often backed up by federal student aid. Contrast this situation with the vast majority of colleges and universities in the U.S., which are nonprofit institutions, which are usually run by a not-for-profit institution, religious organization, or government and hence often receive funding from taxes or a particular religious group.</p>

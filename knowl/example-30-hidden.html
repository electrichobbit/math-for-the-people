<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p>To find the probability of not getting arrested in school in Missouri, we know that there are 915,033 total students, and we also know that only 1,487 were arrested. So we know that the rest of the students were not arrested. So, we can subtract the arrested students from the total students to find the not arrested students, which gives us 913,546 students that were not arrested. We then find the ratio of not arrested students to total students: 913,546/915,033=0.998375, or around 99.3875%.</p>
<p>We can also find this by using the fact that we know the probability of getting arrested. We start with the group of all students (1), and then we subtract out the group that represents getting arrested: 1 - 0.001625=0.998375, or 99.8375%.</p>
<p>We get the same mathematical answers from calculating the complement using either method. It is important to understand both methods because we have to think about the different types of information that we might have available. What is something that we notice in this scenario? Can a person be both arrested and not arrested at the same time? That leads us to our second special scenario.</p></article></body>

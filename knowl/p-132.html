<p>Since interval data is numeric, you can perform any mathematical operation, but interval data does not have any meaningful zero. For example, suppose Sunday at midnight, there was an accident in your neighborhood, and as a result, there was massive traffic in your neighborhood. One way to measure the timing is through a 24-hour clock and say that your neighborhood experienced unusual traffic at 0:00 AM on Sunday. Here zero does not mean that there is an absence of time. Zero is just the measure of the time of the day using a 24-hour clock.</p>

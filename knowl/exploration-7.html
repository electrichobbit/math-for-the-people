</h5>
<p>There were over 204,000 referrals to law enforcement in 2015-2016 in U.S. public schools, almost 52,000 of which were school arrests. The actual number is likely higher due to underreporting.</p>
<p>Consider the table, created using data from CRDC <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-CRights-estimates.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.142">[8.12.142]</a>, that gives rates of school arrests by race and disability status by state per 10,000 in 2015-2016. Because the table is large, it is linked: <a class="external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WFHkK319QGh4kgvfAewJfZCnckO3-vKmiZA-yqvBTHE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">School arrest rates per 10,000 by state, 2015-2016</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-134-hidden.html" title="Footnote 8.9.6"><sup> 6 </sup></a>. This table is a view only Google Sheet. You can create your own copy if you want to edit it.</p>
<p>You can find the table in the CODAP file <a class="external" href="https://codap.concord.org/app/static/dg/en/cert/index.html#shared=https%3A%2F%2Fcfm-shared.concord.org%2FXlRi8Tk40GoNW6RnEAPJ%2Ffile.json" target="_blank">School arrests: rates only</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-135-hidden.html" title="Footnote 8.9.7"><sup> 7 </sup></a>, where you can manipulate the data and do calculations with it. If you are interested in total numbers of arrests and not just the rates, you can find them in the CODAP file <a class="external" href="https://codap.concord.org/app/static/dg/en/cert/index.html#shared=https%3A%2F%2Fcfm-shared.concord.org%2FWtDfDjuRCCtTDxsGZ4m5%2Ffile.json" target="_blank">School arrests: all</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-136-hidden.html" title="Footnote 8.9.8"><sup> 8 </sup></a>.

<li><p>What do you notice about this table? What do you wonder? Remember that there is no right or wrong way to notice and wonder, but try to include mathematical observations.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the data: How do you think the data in this table were collected? What do the data tell us and what are they unable to tell us? What biases may be present in how the data were collected and summarized?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there groups in the table that are mutually exclusive? Explain your reasoning.</p></li>
<li><p>Are there groups that are not mutually exclusive based on the information provided? Explain your reasoning.</p></li>
<li><p>The table gives rates per 10,000. For example, the 10.26 in Arrests per 10000 column for all of United States means that for every 10,000 students in the United States, around 10 were arrested. The arrest rate for students with disabilities in 2015-2016 was 20.69 per 10,000. Who do you think was more likely to be arrested in 2015-2016: students with disabilities or students without disabilities? How do you know?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any particular groups of students who seem to be arrested more than others? What is your evidence for your conclusion?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any particular states or regions that seem to arrest students more than others? What is your evidence for this conclusion? To answer this question you can make a graph in CODAP. For example, you can drag the state attribute to the x-axis and one of the arrest rates to the y-axis.</p></li>
<li>If students from one group are arrested more than is their share of the population, we say that they are disproportionately arrested. Consider the stacked bar graph created from CRDC <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-CRights-estimates.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.142">[8.12.142]</a> data: <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="school-discipline/images/arrests.png" class="contained" alt="Stacked bar graph of enrollment and school arrests by race."></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">8.9.7<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>School enrollment and arrests by race</figcaption></figure> Note that the graph combines Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander students because the percentages of their arrests are all very low and would be hard if not impossible to see on the graph. Of the five groups in the graph, which are disproportionately arrested in schools?</li>
<li><p>Would you say that students with disabilities are also disproportionately arrested in schools? How do you know?</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) There is no information about the breakdown of students arrests by offense. However, media have reported numerous stories of students being arrested for minor infractions. If you are interested, you can find some examples in the document <a class="external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NdIl1hUdew0V5mD-HNnqdcdPHtG0c-03pYoX8hhGO1k/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Articles about individual instances of discipline.</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-138-hidden.html" title="Footnote 8.9.10"><sup> 10 </sup></a></p></li>

<p>Computing the correlation is tricky.  We'll go through the process of computing it, which takes multiple steps, but in general we'll do it using software.  The R programming language lets us easily find the correlation between two sets of numbers.  Here, you'll see the two data sets we looked at above.  The cor function in R calculates the correlation between two sets of numbers - hit "Evaluate R" to calculate.  You can try different values in the exercise below - just hit "Evaluate R" to find the correlation.  You'll see that when we look at the first pair of data sets, the correlation is exactly 1: <pre class="ptx-sagecell sagecell-r" id="sage-16"><script type="text/x-sage">x <- c(1,2,5,6,12)
y <- c(2,4,10,12,24)
cor(x,y)
</script></pre> If we look at the second pair, though, the correlation is a little less than 1. <pre class="ptx-sagecell sagecell-r" id="sage-17"><script type="text/x-sage">x <- c(1,2,5,6,12)
y <- c(2,5,9,14,21)
cor(x,y)
</script></pre> 0.9812022 is still very close to 1, though, because these numbers still mostly fit the pattern - just not perfectly.</p>

<p>One tool that is used to model and understand probability is simulation. In this part of the module, we will be using a simulation to help us explore different probability scenarios to see which behaves most like our target. We can determine if information from an empirical model provides a stable foundation for a theoretical model, meaning it can be replicated or nearly replicated over a number of trials. We can also use a theoretical model to produce simulated samples which can let us know if different empirical models are valid. In this exploration, you will examine a data table that shows the overall population for men's prisons by race <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-BJS-report.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.132">[8.12.132]</a>. Then you will examine three different simulations to see which one you think would be most likely to produce the prison population given.  In reading the output from the simulations, there is an overall summary column presented at the left, which shows the mean proportion for each race for all of the trials. In the center, there are the summaries from each trial, meaning it shows the proportion for each race in each trial. Then in the far right hand column, the raw data is shown. The simulations model the selection of 50 individual prisoners in 25 repeated samples. The variable being simulated is prisoner race because that is what we are interested in modeling. Before you start working with the simulations (where you only need to select “start” to collect data), think about strategies that you can use to see if you think a model will match.</p>

<li><p>The three simulations did not present an exact match to the prison population, but which model do you think was the closest to the prison population model?</p></li>
<li><p>What factors helped you make your decision about fitting the model?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you think that this single variable (prisoner race) was enough to help you make a decision about the model? What additional information would you think would be useful, if any?</p></li>
<li><p>The simulations automatically calculated the proportions of each population group. Explore the data that was produced in the simulations. How does the selection of an individual in the simulation influence the calculated proportion?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Notes about probability: For the exploration you just completed, the outcomes of the probability experiment you conducted were the prisoners that were being simulated. There was also a specific group that was counted to create each proportion. These specific groups were the races of interest being counted. The probability is a ratio of the specific outcome of interest over the total number of outcomes. In the simulations, we looked at different races as the specific outcomes. It may be helpful to revisit the exploration with this definition and see if any of your ideas change.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="school-discipline-solving-for-change.html#exploration-8" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

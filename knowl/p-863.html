<p>If events <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> do not influence the probability of each other happening (they are independent events), you can calculate their joint probability by just multiplying their probabilities together. Consider the act of rolling two dice. An example of two  independent events are <span class="process-math">\(A\text{:}\)</span> rolling a 6, and then <span class="process-math">\(B\text{:}\)</span> rolling an odd number. These events are independent because rolling a 6 with die 1 does not change the probability of rolling an odd number with die 2. Observe that <span class="process-math">\(P(A)=\frac{1}{6}\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(P(B)=\frac{3}{6}\)</span> since there are three odd numbers on a die. We can then use the formula</p>

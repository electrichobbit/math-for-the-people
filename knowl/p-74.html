<p>An <dfn class="terminology">assumption</dfn> is a sentence that is accepted in an argument as true. Some assumptions are understood, or what we call tacit assumptions. An example of a tacit assumption would be the mental image that you generate from the sentence, "Those not yet born have been dehumanized, and so many of those born have faced increasing marginalization due to their age, ability, or perceived value". You most likely imagine a fetus and not a robot or rock. That is because we have a tacit assumption that robots cannot be born. This sentence is part of the mission statement of the pro life advocacy group <a class="external" href="https://aul.org/mission/" target="_blank">Americans United for Life</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-11-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.8.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a></p>

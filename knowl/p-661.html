<p>Mathematically, interest is computed by taking a percentage of the principal.  We can think about interest from two perspectives.  From the perspective of the bank or the person loaning the money, they are making an <em class="emphasis">investment</em> - they give someone a certain amount of money, with the expectation that they will be paid back more money in the future.  From the perspective of the borrower, this money (or the object that they bought with it, like a house or a car) is a <em class="emphasis">loan</em> - they will repay more back in the future than what they borrowed.</p>

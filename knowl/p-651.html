<p>We've learned a lot about payday lenders - how they operate, why people use them, where they are, and what they do.  Now that we understand the sociological aspects of the issue, let's dive into the mathematics.  Mathematics can help us understand just how unfair payday lending is, how these lenders turn a profit, and study the inequity in where payday lenders are located.  We'll learn the mathematics we need to analyze these issues, and then dive into some deeper exploration of the inequity of payday lending.</p>

<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p>In 2015-16, 43.42% of the students, or 21,700,551 students, were in schools with police officers. How many total students were enrolled in schools in 2015-16?</p>
<p>Now we know the part (21,700,551) and the percent (43.42), but not the whole, so in this case,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{21700551}{whole} = 4342/100=0.4342,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and <span class="process-math">\(whole = \frac{21700551}{0.4342} = 49978238\text{,}\)</span>  so there were 49,978,238 students enrolled in public schools in 2015-16.</p></article></body>

<p>Recent data has estimated the worldwide percentage of Spam emails  as 28.5% <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/racism-policing-biblio-spam-email.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 7.10.127">[7.10.127]</a>. A new software company states that their product can detect 98% of emails as spam. Sometimes (2%) of the time, the filter incorrectly labels non-spam emails as spam (false positive). With these percentages in mind, what is the true probability that an email, if labeled spam, is actually a non-spam email? (Hint: there are many ways you can approach this, but it may make sense to use A to model an event that an email is labeled spam, and B to represent that the email actually is spam.)</p>

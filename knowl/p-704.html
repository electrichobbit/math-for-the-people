<p>In this example, $20 may not seem like a lot - it's only 10% of the $200 that they borrowed.  Remember, though, that when we talk about interest rates, we talk about <em class="emphasis">annual</em> percentage rates.  This is 10% over two weeks - if you don't pay the $20 at the end of the first two weeks, you'll be charged another $20 at the end of the next two weeks! There are 52 weeks in the year, so by the end of the year (26 two-week periods) you would have paid <span class="process-math">\(26*20 = \$520\)</span> in interest - that's <span class="process-math">\(\frac{520}{200} = 2.6 = 260\%\)</span> of the amount you borrowed!  The annual percentage rate is 260%!</p>

<p>Note: Although <em class="emphasis">race</em> is regarded as a social construct by scientists from a wide variety of backgrounds <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/racism-policing-biblio-nature-race.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 7.10.123">[7.10.123]</a>, we acknowledge the very real racialized oppression that many groups experience in the United States. The use of race as a variable in this data is borne out of the necessity of shedding light on this oppression. In some cases police report the race of the person they stop, and in some cases it is also self-reported, which can lead to some uncertainty.</p>

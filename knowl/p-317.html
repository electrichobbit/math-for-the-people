<p>Because we could expect the mean and median to be close in a state that has not been gerrymandered, the mean-median difference produces a measure of skew between the two. The mean-median difference can help to identify district plans that are likely to have been crafted with partisan influence. The test for significance presented here is more effective in states where the vote is closely divided (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/gerrymandering-gerrymandering-Wang-Three-Tests.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 4.12.49">[4.12.49]</a>, with some discussion of this in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/gerrymandering-extreme-maps.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 4.12.42">[4.12.42]</a>). Unlike the efficiency gap, this test does not indicate how many more seats the gerrymandering party won. We note here again that both of these measures only use party affiliation and election results, with no accounting for other factors that may be influential.</p>

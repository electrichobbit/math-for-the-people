<p>Consider the table below, giving the number of school resource officers, number of public schools, and the number of public schools with school resource officers, by full- and part-time school resource officer status, for selected years from 2003–04 to 2015–16 <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-NCES-officers.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.137">[8.12.137]</a>:</p>

<p>NOTE: In 2003–04, schools reported on school resource officers present at their school on a regular basis. In 2005–06, 2007–08, 2009–10, and 2015–16, schools reported on school resource officers present at their school at least once a week.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Give at least three observations you can make about the data in the table.</p></li>
<li><p>How much did the number of SROs in schools change between 2003-04 and 2015-2016? Give the total and percent change.</p></li>
<li><p>What percentage of schools had SROs in 2003-2004? What percentage of schools had SROs in 2015-2016? How did the percentage change?</p></li>
<li><p>Why do you think the number of SROs has gone up so much since 2003?</p></li>
<li>Consider the graph below, based on data from NCES <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-NCES-officers.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.137">[8.12.137]</a>. <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="school-discipline/images/SROgraph.png" class="contained" alt="Bar graph of prevalence of SROs by free and reduced lunch."></div>

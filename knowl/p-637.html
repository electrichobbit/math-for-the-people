<p>The government - both state and federal governments in the US - is also an important provider of loans.  These loans are either provided directly by the government or secured by the government (a private bank makes the loan, and the government provides the security for the borrower). In some cases - like subsidized student loans - the government may even pay part of the interest.  Government loans provide access to money for people in need, but the process for getting one can be complicated and take time.  In addition, many government loans are restricted to particular groups, like veterans, small businesses, or first-time college students.</p>

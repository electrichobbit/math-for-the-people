<p><dfn class="terminology">Partisan gerrymandering</dfn> is the practice of drawing district lines to maximize a political party's advantage in elected representatives. In this type of gerrymandering, voters and representatives of the party in power benefit as an increased delegation directly impacts the laws and policies that are able to pass in government, both on the state and national levels. On the other hand, voters and representatives of the party not in power suffer from being underrepresented in government and may be victims of a cycle where the opposing party maintains their power through the redistricting process.</p>

<p>The important thing to know about a pie chart is that the bigger the area of the sectors, the greater the values they represent. That means, in the given pie chart, since the area of the sector representing “Access to healthy drinking water” is the highest (20% of the total area), you can conclude that out of the nine given issues, the respondents chose "Access to healthy drinking water” the maximum number of times. To be precise, 20% of the times respondents said that they were concerned about healthy drinking water. Likewise, the area of the sector representing “Risk of flooding/ forest fire” is the smallest (2% of the total area), the pie chart suggests that only 2% of times respondents said that they were concerned about flooding and forest fire.</p>

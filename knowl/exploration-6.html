<p>Read the following excerpt from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-ACLU-report.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.129">[8.12.129]</a>:</p>
<p>"Given the importance of these providers, experts and professional organizations provide recommended student-to-SBHM provider ratios. The American School Counselor Association recommends a ratio of 250 students per counselor. The National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) recommends a ratio of 500-700 students per school psychologist, depending on the comprehensiveness of services being provided. School Social Work Association of America (SSWAA) recommends that social work services should also be provided at a ratio of 250 students to one social worker. Several states, along with the American Nurses Association, recommend a ratio of one school nurse to 750 students in healthy student populations."</p>
<p>Consider the table adapted from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-ACLU-report.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.129">[8.12.129]</a> that gives the numbers of counselors, social workers, psychologists, nurses, teachers, law enforcement, and security guards in U.S. public schools by state in 2015-2016. You can find the table in <a class="external" href="https://codap.concord.org/app/static/dg/en/cert/index.html#shared=https%3A%2F%2Fcfm-shared.concord.org%2FSOrntgcLrvXC7gQ6Qxga%2Ffile.json" target="_blank">CODAP</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-132-hidden.html" title="Footnote 8.9.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a> or in <a class="external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n5yJT_OwsdTELlJ2EQczIT1h1xvd2TKnaGs-ggg0TpM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Sheets</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-133-hidden.html" title="Footnote 8.9.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a> (this sheet is view only). Note that the numbers of teachers, law enforcement, and security guides are provided for your information only. You will not need this information.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Select a state. You can choose the state where you currently live, the state in which you were born, the state where you went to school, or even just a state that interests you. How many students went to school in that state in 2015-2016? (Note: Hawaii and Florida have data that may have been underreported. If you choose one of these two states, you will have to decide how to deal with the missing or incomplete information.)</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the number of counselors, school psychologists, social workers, and nurses that should have been employed in that state’s public schools in 2015-2016 according to the recommended ratios from the paragraph. If you wish, you can use CODAP to calculate the answers.</p></li>
<li><p>Compare your calculated answers with actual numbers of counselors, social workers, psychologists, and nurses in the table for your chosen state. How do the numbers compare?</p></li>
<li><p>What did you learn from this investigation and what do you still wish to know?</p></li>

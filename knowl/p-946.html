<p>Probability is a specific type of ratio that allows the comparison of specific outcomes with the entire group of outcomes. We see probability expressed in three ways: as a fraction ranging from 0 to 1, as a decimal ranging from 0 to 1, and as a percentage ranging from 0% to 100%. All three of these expressions allow us to see a part and a whole, even if in the case of decimals and percentages where the whole is adjusted to be a multiple of ten. These different expressions can be seen in the Probability Scale below.</p>

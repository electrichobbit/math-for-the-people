<p>Fake news is one type of “misinformation” or disinformation.” However, much of the “news” can be simply misleading. Some people or news outlets convey misleading quantitative information unconsciously; some do it deliberately. Researchers often present numerical results, and conclusions based on those results, without also putting forth enough effort to calculate and report the uncertainties and inaccuracies in those results.

<p>This means that there is a negative correlation between the percentage of a county which is white and the number of payday lenders - that is, the more white people live in a county, the fewer payday lenders will you find.  Because Alabama is largely a biracial state (with non-white and non-Black minority populations making up a very small percentage of the population), we see a similar (but reversed) correlation between Black population and payday lenders of 0.67 - so more Black people in a county corresponds to more payday lenders. The R code to calculate that correlation is next.</p>

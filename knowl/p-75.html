<p>Other assumptions are stated more directly. This means that the assumptions are made explicit. When we make explicit assumptions, we speak them directly. An example of a directly spoken assumption would be the following quote,"We see that criminalization is not as much about the behavior of the individual, but the individual itself and the identities that they hold. We know that Black and Latinx and other folks of color are more likely to be criminalized by our criminal legal system. We know the same thing is true for young people, LGBTQ folks, undocumented communities. So the risks are high for criminalization overall. We are seeing this play out in the reproductive health care space right now and it's going to get worse."-Jamila Perritt, MD, MPH, FACOGâ€”President &amp; CEO of Physicians for Reproductive Health <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/abortion-equity.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 1.12.7">[1.12.7]</a></p>

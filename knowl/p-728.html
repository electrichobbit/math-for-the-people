<p>A payday lender loans you $200 with a $30 fee, to be paid back in 2 weeks.  If you don't pay it back in 2 weeks, you'll be charged another $30 fee, and another $30 for each 2 weeks after that.  They think that there is a 10% chance you'll pay it back in 2 weeks, a 20% chance you'll pay it back in 4 weeks, a 60% chance you'll pay it back in 6 weeks, and a 10% chance you won't pay it back at all.  What is the expected value of the loan for the lender?</p>

<p>What counts as an honest graph that is not “fake news”? It is tricky to decide and a lot of it depends on the context. Consider the climate change graph back in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fake-news-misleading-graphs-figure-climate.html" title="Figure 3.6.1">Figure 3.6.1</a>. It had a y-axis that ranged from -0.5 C to + 1.0 C. For those of you more accustomed to Fahrenheit rather than Celsius, that’s roughly -1 F to +2 F. You may be thinking, only two degrees hotter? I would barely notice that outside, is this a misleading graph? The thing to keep in mind with this graph is the context. Scientists think that every 0.5 C increase has extremely important impacts on our ability to survive on this planet <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fake-news-biblio-climate-change-report.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 3.10.1.25">[3.10.1.25]</a>. Although it might seem like the graph is making a lot out of a little, it is probably a fair graph rather than a misleading one. It is important to consider the context when trying to judge where the y-axis and the x-axis should begin and end. Interpreting numbers always requires critical thinking about what is “a lot” and what is “a little.”</p>

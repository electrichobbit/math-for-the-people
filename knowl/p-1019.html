<p>In 2011, researchers from the Council of State Governments Justice Center in partnership with the Public Policy Research Institute at Texas A &amp; M University published a report <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-Texas-study.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.133">[8.12.133]</a> based on data from all public school students in Texas who were in seventh grade in 2000, 2001, and 2002. The researchers followed these students for at least six years, with access to academic and juvenile records. Among the researchers’ findings was that only 3% of the offenses for which students are disciplined are ones where by law schools are required to suspend or expel. The other 97% are at administrators’ discretion.</p>

<p>Similarly, in North Carolina, a state whose votes are nearly evenly split between the two major parties (see the <a class="external" href="https://er.ncsbe.gov/" target="_blank">North Carolina Election Results Dashboard (opens in new tab)</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-51-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.6.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> for specific information), the congressional plan was challenged due to the Republicans winning 10 of the 13 districts in the 2016 elections. The case made it all the way to the Supreme Court, who ruled in 2019 in <em class="emphasis">Rucho v. Common Cause</em> that the constitutionality of partisan gerrymandering was not a federal issue and left it to states to decide. (For more information, see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/gerrymandering-Rucho.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 4.12.45">[4.12.45]</a>.) Following this ruling, a state court in North Carolina ruled in <em class="emphasis">Common Cause v. Lewis</em> (2019) that their map was unconstitutional and needed to be redrawn ahead of the 2020 elections. The new map immediately changed the outcomes as Democrats won 2 additional seats (5 rather than 3) in 2020.</p>

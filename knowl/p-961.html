<p>One consideration in probability is the consideration of if events can occur at the same time. One example of events that cannot occur at the same time are an event and its complement, so thinking about our prior example a student cannot be both arrested and not arrested at the same time. This is an example of mutually exclusive events. But when we start to think about more complicated events, like can you be a specific race and be suspended from school, the events become more complicated. Understanding if events are mutually exclusive or not, allows for better and more accurate methods of calculating probabilities. Having more accurate probability calculations can help us make more informed judgments about issues.</p>

<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p>Determine if you think the following event pairs are mutually exclusive or not. Explain to yourself why you think they are or are not mutually exclusive. What information did you use to make your decisions?</p>
<p>Event Pair A: Being Black and Getting suspended from school</p>
<p>Event Pair B: Being truant and Having regular school attendance</p>
<p>Event Pair C: Making good grades and Being disciplined in school</p>
<p>Following up: Based on models we have looked at, we realize that being Black and getting suspended can happen together, so those events are not mutually exclusive. When I know that being truant means not attending school regularly, I realize that the events in Event pair B are complements and have to be mutually exclusive. Event pair C is the most difficult to really take apart. Common sense-wise and experience-wise it seems like maybe the people who got good grades didn’t get in real trouble at school, but then again there is no reason why they couldn’t get into trouble. This means that they have to be not mutually exclusive events.</p></article></body>

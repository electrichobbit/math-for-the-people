<p>Does this mean that bees are breaking up marriages in South Carolina, or that new divorcees are running out to start beekeeping? Of course not (or at least, probably not).  We don't have any other reason to believe that one of these variables is causing the other.  But when there is some reason why we might believe that one thing is causing another, the correlation can give us evidence to support that theory.</p>

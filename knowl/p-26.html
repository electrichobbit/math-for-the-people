<p>The first sentence is a sentence which is true, making the sentence a mathematical statement. The second sentence is false which also means that it is a mathematical statement. Lastly, the third sentence is an opinion which is neither true nor false. Therefore, the third sentence is not a mathematical statement. Determining if a sentence is a statement can be challenging as this causes us to challenge the difference between our individual belief systems and factual information. We will discuss this in further detail in our last section of this module.</p>

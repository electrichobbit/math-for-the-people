<p>In this module, we begin by attempting to understand student loan debt through an analysis of media and political claims and the academic literature. Specifically, we ask:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>What are the causes of the current level of student loan debt?</p></li>
<li><p>Who benefits from the high rate of student loan debt in the U.S.?</p></li>
<li><p>How does the load of student loan debt impact college students' and graduates' lives?</p></li>
<li><p>What factors, including time and the nonprofit status of a college, impact the burden of debt faced by students?</p></li>
<li><p>How do historical and present inequities, such as systemic racism, impact student loan debt load and default rates?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the federal government doing in response to the large amount of student loan debt in the U.S.?</p></li>
</ul>

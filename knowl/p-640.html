<p>Pawns generally offer more favorable interest rates than payday loans, since the loan is secured.  However, the borrower loses the ability to use whatever they have pawned while the money is borrowed.  For something like jewelry, that can mean living with the anxiety of losing a valuable or sentimental item.  For something like electronics, it could impact their ability to communicate or work.</p>

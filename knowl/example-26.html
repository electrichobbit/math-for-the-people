<p>In 2013-14, there were approximately 49 million students enrolled in public schools. Out of those students, 5.3% were suspended or expelled. How many students were suspended or expelled?</p>
<p>In this case, we know the whole (49 million) and the percent (5.3), but we do not know the part. Therefore,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{part}{49} = \frac{5.3}{100} = 0.053,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>so <span class="process-math">\(part = 0.053 \cdot 49=2.597\text{,}\)</span> so about 2.6 million students were suspended or expelled in 2013-14.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="school-discipline-math-topic-percents.html#example-26" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

</h3>The data in the table below is taken from a report by the American Civil Rights Union (ACLU) <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-ACLU-report.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.129">[8.12.129]</a>. The report states that students in these three states have the same general probability of being arrested per 10,000 students. For many states being arrested as a form of school discipline aligns with zero tolerance offenses that qualify for expulsion. For this reason, we may make a reasonable assumption that students may not be arrested multiple times as a form of school discipline.<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-ACLU-report.html">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{|c||c|c|}\hline \text{State}\amp \text{Total Students}\amp \text{Total Arrests}\\ \hline \text{Missouri}\amp 915,033\amp 1,487\\ \hline \text{Arkansas}\amp 480,300\amp 751 \\ \hline
\text{Rhode Island}\amp 141,210\amp 231 \\ \hline \end{array}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Our first step to exploring the claim in the document is to think about the probability that we want to build. If you are a student going to school, when it comes to being arrested, you either get arrested at school or you don’t get arrested at school. So we have two groups of students, those that get arrested and those that don’t get arrested. We also happen to know about the number of students that get arrested, as well as how many students there are. This means that we have everything we need.</p>
<p>To find the probability of being arrested, we find the ratio of arrests to students for each state. For this example, we will model with Missouri and you can test your ideas on Arkansas and Rhode Island.</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-ACLU-report.html">
\begin{equation*}
\text{arrests}/\text{(total students)}=1487/915033.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We can reduce this to a decimal figure, as finding common factors or a reduced form fraction is highly unlikely. This yields approximately 0.001625.Now we want to know how this fits with thinking about the probability of being arrested per 10,000 students. In other words, if the probability of getting arrested is 0.001625, this is about 0.1625%; how many arrests would that be among 10,000 students? We use this previously calculated value and solve an equation, to find a value out of 10000:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-ACLU-report.html">
\begin{equation*}
0.001625=p/10000
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Solving this equation gives a value of 16 whole students in Missouri per 10000 based on the overall probability. The report claims that you have the same probability per 10000 in all three states. Can you verify the claim?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="school-discipline-math-topic-probability.html#arrests" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

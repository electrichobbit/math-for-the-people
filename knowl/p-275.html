<p>But what is <em class="emphasis">compactness</em>, and why should we care about districts having nice shapes? <dfn class="terminology">Compactness</dfn> is a quantitative measure of a district's shape and how tightly packed, or compact, the region is. Remember that the function of a political district is to elect someone that <em class="emphasis">represents</em> the people, needs, and interests of an area. A district over a more compact area is likely to include towns and communities with similar interests, while a district that zigs and zags across a state is more likely to intentionally exclude certain groups of people and connect regions with different local interests. In fact, most states include language emphasizing the importance of “compactness” of their districts but lack a definition or a way to measure this characteristic.</p>

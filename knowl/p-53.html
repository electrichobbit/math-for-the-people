<p>Notice that there is no overlap shown between the set of people that deserve vacations and the set of people that support abortions. We are starting with a diagram that matches the original claim of the statement. We use this to establish the initial truth value of the statement. Vacations tend to be labeled as something that is a privilege, but really vacations are just a break from work or school (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vacation). It appears that everyone deserves a vacation, so the set of all people and the set of people that deserve a vacation are equivalent sets. We also know that people that support abortion are people, who would also need a vacation. This means that the initial claim is false. Letâ€™s think about strategies to work with the statement, so that we can approach negation. Our first step would be to update the set diagram.</p>

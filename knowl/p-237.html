<p>We hope that these skills will make you a more informed consumer who will not be taken in by fake news either in the mass media or on social media. Just as the 15th century residents of Trent were moved by fake news to commit horrible crimes against their Jewish residents, the story spread throughout Europe and caused further bigotry and violence. The more people with the skills to stop the spread of fake news by refusing to share it and pointing out its flaws, the more likely we are to reach a more socially just world.</p>

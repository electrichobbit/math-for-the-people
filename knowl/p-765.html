<p>That's $1,992 in interest on a $300 loan - about $75 every two weeks.  Payday lenders tend to break their loans down into smaller amounts in order to make it seem like less.  Rather than saying $1,992 in interest every year, or even $75 every two weeks on a $300 loan, they would say, "Our fee is $25 for every $100 you borrow, paid back after two weeks."  If that 2 weeks ends, and you can't re-pay the loan...another $25 for every $100 is charged.  For a borrower struggling to make ends meet, the fees add up like clockwork.</p>

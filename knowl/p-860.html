<p>of the drivers stopped were Black in Hartford and Philadelphia, respectively. We now compare these percentages to 2015 population data from the US Census Bureau. For Hartford, 37.3\% of the drivers stopped were Black and 38\% of the population was Black--these numbers seem to indicate that Black drivers were not stopped more frequently than drivers of other races <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/racism-policing-biblio-census-hartford.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 7.10.125">[7.10.125]</a>. In Philadelphia, however, 64.2\% of the drivers stopped were Black while only 42.4\% of the population was Black <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/racism-policing-biblio-census-philadelphia.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 7.10.126">[7.10.126]</a>. It seems as though Black drivers were disproportionately stopped in Philadelphia during this time. Let's use the data on searches, contraband, and arrests to give us more insight.</p>

<p>This equivalence of sets helps give us a strategy for negation. We know that every child is in both the set of all children and the set of children that deserve to live. If we can find a single child that does not belong in the set of children that deserve to live but still belongs to the set of all children, then we can negate the statement with the claim, "At least one child does not deserve to live." It seriously only takes one to negate the statement, but we know that case is not likely to exist. Another equivalent statement that is an option for a negation is the statement, "Some children do not deserve to live." These two statements both claim that there are children that do not belong in the set of children that deserve to live.</p>

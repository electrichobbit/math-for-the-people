<p>In this scenario, there is a much narrower range of possibilities as we know that <em class="emphasis">at least</em> 85 of White voters voted for the Heart  candidate in this precinct. (Why? Check: since there are only 5 total votes for the Club candidate, there could be at most 5 votes for the Club candidate that came from White voters.) That means at least <span class="process-math">\(85/90 = 94 \%\)</span> of White voters voted for the Heart candidate, so it appears that White voters have a strong preference for the Heart candidate. We could then investigate precincts with a small percentage of White voters to estimate the vote choice of other racial groups.</p>

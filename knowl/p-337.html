<p>Let's suppose a state with 7 districts has a proposed district plan in which the Heart Party is favored to win 6 of the 7 districts. A computer program generates 1,000,000 possible district plans and in only 100 of the plans is the Heart Party favored to win as many as 6 of the districts. Due to the unlikely nature of this outcome (occurring in only 0.01% of plans), there is evidence that the proposed plan may have been manipulated to benefit the Heart Party. That is, it represents a potential outlier.</p>

<p>Say that you want to borrow $1000 from a bank via an unsecured loan. If the loan were secured, and you didn't pay it back, the bank could seize your house or car or whatever you had secured the loan with.  Since it's unsecured, the bank will lose all of the money that they loaned you if you don't pay it back.  Therefore, they want to make the expected value of loaning you money positive (for them) - that is, they want to ensure that on average the money that you pay them in interest makes up for the risk of you not paying the loan back.</p>

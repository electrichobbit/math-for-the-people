<p>When the misinformation is about whether or not a particular celebrity is romantically involved with another celebrity, the potential for harm is not high. But attempts at social justice can be thwarted by the spread of false or misleading information. One issue concerns which problems a given society faces. Is crime going up or down? If it is going up, then it is easier to convince people to divert public funds towards policing. If it is going down, perhaps such money could be spent on rehabilitation of criminals. A related question is whether or not police in a given area disproportionately kill people of color. If a problem does not appear to exist, it is difficult to build political will towards solving it. The same difficulty occurs with global climate change. Is the global temperature average increasing? Are humans causing it? Will it cause problems? If the public believes that the answer to any of these questions is “no” then the public will not support climate change abatement efforts.</p>

<p>A <dfn class="terminology">definition</dfn> is a common meaning for a term that is held by a group. For example, if you asked various people to define the term dog, you would get similar answers from almost everyone that you asked. That is because the definition has many commonly experienced attributes such as being a pet or companion. One thing to be mindful about with definitions is that not all groups hold common definitions for the same term. One example would be the definition of abortion held by different groups. Some consider any termination of a pregnancy, no matter the reason, to be an abortion. Other groups consider abortion to be any elective termination of a pregnancy. This slight difference in how the groups define the common term can make discussions between individuals contentious.</p>

<p>First, create a frequency distribution table, as in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/environmental-racism-neighborhood-issues.html" title="Table 2.6.3">TableÂ 2.6.3</a>, where you will note how many times a particular category has been repeated or the given values corresponding to different categories. For example, question 2 of the "Neighborhood welfare survey" asked the respondents to indicate all the neighbourhood-related issues they were concerned about. The question provided the respondents with nine options. Each option would form one category. The survey response suggests that 20 respondents expressed their concern about access to healthy drinking water. Hence the frequency corresponding to "access to healthy drinking water" is 20.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="environmental-racism-choosing-data-visualization.html#li-128" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

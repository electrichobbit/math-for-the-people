<p>We defined <dfn class="terminology">compactness</dfn> above as a measure of how tightly packed a district is. The most compact district, then, is one that is as tightly packed as possible. If we are constructing our districts from squares in the grid, what shape would be as tightly packed as possible? We would want smooth edges, without any parts sticking out, so we might try to arrange our squares into a rectangular region. But a long, skinny rectangle would not be considered as tightly packed as possible: we could tighten it up even more by getting the side lengths to all be the same. Our most compact shape, then, is a square.</p>

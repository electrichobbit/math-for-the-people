<p>The section on error analysis focused on how easily small errors can add up to large ones and offered the Five Cs to help you decide how strong evidence is. At the low end of the Five C’s you can see how coincidence and correlation can easily contain errors whereas when you reach consensus, you have such a strong body of evidence from a variety of sources, errors are substantially less likely. So, when you encounter news that makes claims about what the problems are in our society and more importantly, what causes them, you can ask which C they are relying on to make this claim. You can also challenge others who try to argue for a claim with only the low C’s as their support.</p>

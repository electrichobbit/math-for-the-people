<p>We've talked about how banks, the government, and other entities make decisions about who they will loan money to.  Those decisions are made primarily on the basis of two things: credit history and access to security.  If someone has a strong credit history - they have borrowed money and paid it back on time - or if they have access to property or someone with credit history to secure their loan - then they can obtain favorable terms for a loan.  If they do not have either of those things, then they are left to borrow money from lenders who demand much higher interest payments.</p>

<p>Developed nations, on the other hand, argued that emissions reductions must be made by developing nations like China and India, because those nations account for such a large part of current emissions. While Asia accounts for 29% of historical emissions since 1750, in 2019 they accounted for 55% of current emissions, as seen in Figure <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/greenhouse-gas-figure-annual-co2-emissions-region.html" title="Figure 5.8.2">FigureÂ 5.8.2</a>.  Because they account for such a large part of current emissions, substantial reductions in their emissions would make a much larger difference in future CO2 levels.</p>

<p>According to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/greenhouse-gas-biblio-emissions-by-region.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 5.11.1.80">[5.11.1.80]</a>, global CO2 emissions were 37.1 billion tons in 2021.  Write this number in scientific notation.  If there were 7.8 billion people, how many tons of CO2 emissions would that be per person?</p>
<p>Is this a reasonable way to look at per capita emissions? Consider the following two statements:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>The average person worldwide uses ___ tons of CO2 per year.</p></li>
<li><p>On average, each person worldwide uses ___ tons of CO2 per year.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">where the blank is filled in with your answer.  Do you agree with these statements? Why or why not? What is the danger of using an average with a quantity like this</p>
<p>Repeat this exercise with just the US (2021 emissions: 5 billion tons, population 331.9 million people).  Do these numbers have the same problems as the ones above? Explain.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="greenhouse-gas-exercises.html#exercise-83" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

<p>A related issue in redistricting is that of <dfn class="terminology">prison gerrymandering</dfn>, which is the longstanding Census practice of counting people who are incarcerated as "residents" of the town of the prison facility as opposed to residents of the town in which they are from. Maryland and New York became the first two states to ban this practice and adjust their Census data in the 2011 redistricting cycle and a handful of states followed suit for the 2021 cycle. From a voting perspective, why is prison gerrymandering an issue? (What laws exist regarding <dfn class="terminology">felony disenfranchisement</dfn>, the right of incarcerated people to vote?) Furthermore, why is prison gerrymandering a social justice issue?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="gerrymandering-reflection.html#exercise-38" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

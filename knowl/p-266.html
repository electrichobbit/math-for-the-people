<p>Much like the U.S. Congress is divided into a Senate and a House of Representatives, state legislatures (governments) are also divided into two “houses.” (Note: Nebraska is an exception as they are the only state with a single-house legislature.) The number of districts in state legislatures varies by state, but is also subject to decennial redistricting to account for population changes and shifts. For example, Connecticut's State Senate has 36 districts and their State House of Representatives has 151 districts. The full listings of the number of legislative districts by state is available online. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/gerrymandering-ballotpedia-table.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 4.12.46">[4.12.46]</a>.</p>

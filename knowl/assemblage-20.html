<p>Suppose you have multiple different possible events, each with some probability of occurring, and each with some "reward" our "benefit" (penalties or losses are represented as negative rewards).  Then the expected value is found by taking the probability of each event times the reward of that event, and adding them up:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
P(event 1)*R(event 1) + P(event 2)*R(event 2)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where P(event) is the probability of the event, and R(event) is the reward.  You can continue this for more than 2 events - just multiply the probability times the reward and add it on.</p>
<p>The expected value tells you, on average, how much you can expect to "win" each time an event happens, by averaging out the wins and losses.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="payday-loans-risk.html#assemblage-20" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

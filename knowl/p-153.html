<p>The histogram given in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/environmental-racism-figure-histogram.html" title="Figure 2.6.6">Figure 2.6.6</a>, represents the frequency distribution of the “annual household income”. In this histogram, the data has been used to create five bins of size $5,000 along the <em class="emphasis">x</em>-axis, and the frequency of responses has been recorded along the <em class="emphasis">y</em>-axis. The important thing to know about a histogram is that the taller the bars are, the greater the frequency they represent. That means, in the given histogram, since the height of the first bin is the highest, 20 to be exact, you can conclude that 20 respondents said that their annual household income is between $30,000 and $35,000.</p>

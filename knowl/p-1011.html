<p>Notes about probability: For the exploration you just completed, the outcomes of the probability experiment you conducted were the prisoners that were being simulated. There was also a specific group that was counted to create each proportion. These specific groups were the races of interest being counted. The probability is a ratio of the specific outcome of interest over the total number of outcomes. In the simulations, we looked at different races as the specific outcomes. It may be helpful to revisit the exploration with this definition and see if any of your ideas change.</p>

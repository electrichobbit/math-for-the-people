<p>Lenders make many arguments about why they should be able to charge these rates.  Sometimes they say that because people are willing to pay their rates, they should be able to charge them - if it were too much, no one would pay them.  They say that they have to charge such high interest rates because the risk of default - a borrower not paying back their loan - is so high.  And they make the argument that if they didn't lend money to these people, no one else would.</p>

<p>Where people live and the evolution of neighborhoods in the United States are greatly impacted by the history of <dfn class="terminology">redlining</dfn> and housing/zoning policies. Written by Richard Rothstein in 2017, <em class="emphasis">The Color of Law</em> covers the history of policies that have contributed to housing discrimination such as restrictive covenants, blockbusting, access to government loans, racial zoning, the Interstate Highway System, and the location of schools. Research redlining and some of these policies and answer the following questions: How have our neighborhoods become racially segregated? What is the history of housing discrimination in your own town? How does this relate to redistricting?</p>

<p>On the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis, we've grouped our values into intervals--the leftmost interval goes from 0 to 2, inclusive. The height of the bar in this interval (called the <dfn class="terminology">frequency</dfn>) is 3, since there are three values (<span class="process-math">\(1,2,2\)</span>) in our data in this interval. The next interval goes from 2 to 4. The interval includes 4 but it does not include 2. The frequency here is 4, because our data included three 3s and one 4. The third interval goes from 4 to 6, and again includes its upper endpoint, 6, but not its lower endpoint, 4. The frequency here is 4, because our data included two 5s and two 6s. The final two intervals are from 6 to 8 (including 8 but not 6) and 8 to 10 (including 10 but not 8). The frequencies in the last two intervals are 4 and 3, respectively.</p>

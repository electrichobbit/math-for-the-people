<p>Finally, on January <span class="process-math">\(10\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(2023\text{,}\)</span> President Biden proposed a novel income-based federal student loan repayment plan <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/bernardWhatKnowBiden2023.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 9.11.146: What to Know About Biden's Income-Driven Repayment Proposal">[9.11.146]</a>. Why did President Biden feel the political impetus to forgive student loan debt? What were the political causes of and blowback to these debt forgiveness actions, and why were they so controversial? Whether or not Biden's loan forgiveness policy is overturned by the Supreme Court, what would its impacts be, and should future Presidents and legislators continue to advocate for student loan forgiveness?</p>

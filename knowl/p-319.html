<p>In 1986, the Supreme Court case <em class="emphasis">Thornburg v. Gingles (1986)</em> further established what constitues an illegal racial gerrymander by adding a set of criteria known as the <em class="emphasis">Gingles test</em>:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>a racial minority group forms a numerical majority of voting-age population in a compact geographic area</p></li>
<li><p>the minority group is “politically cohesive” (members of the group vote similiarly)</p></li>
<li><p>the racial majority group is also politically cohesive but for a different political party (their preferred candidate defeats minority group's preferred candidate)</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">The last two criteria are collectively known as <em class="emphasis">racially polarized voting</em>. If all three criteria are met, the law requires states to draw a <em class="emphasis">majority-minority district</em> in that geographic area. This means that the majority of a district's population are of a minority race, ethnic, or language group. These required districts are often referred to as <em class="emphasis">VRA districts</em>.</p>

<p>There are 2 different situations here - either you don't pay the loan back in 2 years, or you do.  If you don't (1% chance), then the bank loses $5000 (they loaned you $10,000, and the debt collector only paid them $5,000). If you do pay it back (99% chance), then the bank gains the interest you paid back. After 2 years of 4.25% simple interest, you pay the bank back</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
10000 + 10000*0.0425*2 = \$10,850
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">The bank earned $850 (they loaned you $10,000, and got $10,850 back).  The expected value for the bank is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
0.01*(-5000) + 0.99*(850) = \$791.50
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">If they made many loans like this, on average, they would earn $791.50 per customer.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example of how error gets magnified that also illustrates rigor: Suppose I want to calculate the volume of a large cubic concrete tank. Well, that’s pretty easy from a math perspective. The volume of a cube is the length of one side cubed, or <span class="process-math">\(V = L^3\text{,}\)</span> where V is volume and L is length. So, I just have to measure the length of a side. I take a tape measure and measure the side. Let’s say I measure it at 36 inches. There is an inherent inaccuracy to the tape measure; let’s say it is <span class="process-math">\(/pm 1/8\)</span> in. Oh, and did I make sure that the tape measure was completely straight and rigid from one side to the other? Maybe not. Maybe there’s a 1-inch error because of that. Or maybe I stretched my arms so far, I really only “eyeballed” the length.</p>

<p>We can use the membership of the set and subset to help develop strategies for negating statements. As previously stated, negations switch the truth value of a statement. This would also be true for quantified statements, except the change happens by altering the quantity. We established previously that the statement "Some abortions are medically necessary," is a true statement. So we need to think about ways to use quantity and set membership to change the truth value. In this case, our negation would be to find a false statement. Since we know that some abortions are for medical reasons, the most direct negation is to claim that no abortions are medically necessary. We know that this statement is false, as we can produce information about abortions that are medically necessary for the safety of the mother. The statement, "No abortions are medically necessary," would propose that there is not an element in the set abortions for medical reasons.This switches the truth value from the original statement, "Some abortions are medically necessary."</p>

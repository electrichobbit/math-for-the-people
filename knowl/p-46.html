<p>Let's consider the statement that some abortions are medically necessary. The word some is a quantifier. The reference set is the set of all abortions. The set of abortions for medical reasons is what we would consider a subset. Exploring the legitimacy of this subset is how we decide on strategies for negation. Our main strategy is driven by determining if there are abortions in the subset "abortions for medical reasons." A quick web search can help us determine if there are abortions for medical reasons (see <a class="external" href="https://www.health.com/news/abortion-medically-necessary" target="_blank">https://www.health.com/news/abortion-medically-necessary</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-10-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.6.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> as an example), meaning that the set of abortions for medical reasons is not an empty set. This web article discusses that the medical reason may be for both the mother or the unborn fetus. We can use our understanding of the characteristics and membership of the sets to help us think further when working with statements about the sets.</p>

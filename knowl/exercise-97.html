<p>In Islamic law, <em class="emphasis">riba</em>, which can mean interest or excessive interest, depedning on interpretation, is prohibited. Instead, a system called <em class="emphasis">murabaha</em> is used.  Explain what murabaha is and how it differs from an interest-bearing loan.  Do you think this system is more or less fair to borrowers? Is it more or less fair to lenders? Explain why you gave the answers that you did.  Do you think this system could be a good alternative to payday loans? Why or why not?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="payday-loan-reflection.html#exercise-97" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

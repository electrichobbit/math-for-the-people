<p>Access to abortion can be a very difficult topic of conversation particularly for people with opposing views. However, whether a conversation is between two people with opposing views or similar views, it is important that we are mindful of how opinions can influence tacit assumptions and fallacies. It is unlikely that you will be able to change the opinions of other people, but being able to provide factual information and state sound, valid arguments that are free of fallacies will help increase awareness of the consequences of restricting or banning access to abortion. One such major consequence is the inequity of abortion access that is felt primarily by low-income individuals.</p>

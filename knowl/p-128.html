<p>Like nominal data, you can count ordinal data and use them to calculate the number of times or the percentage of times a particular category has been selected. However, some disagreement exists about whether you can perform any other mathematical operations, especially calculate the average, with Ordinal Data. When Ordinal data is in non-numeric form, you cannot calculate its average and measure the average response of the respondents. However, sometimes numbers are assigned to the different categories of Ordinal data for easier data entry and analysis (5: Extremely satisfied, 4: satisfied, 3: Average, 2: Dissatisfied, and 1: Extremely Dissatisfied). Although these numbers do not have any true mathematical value, you can often use these numbers to calculate the average response under the assumption that the difference in degree between consecutive categories is approximately equal.</p>

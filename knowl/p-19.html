<p>These attempts primarily arise when a state passes their own law defining when and how a person can legally get an abortion. When a state passes their own laws, the legality of these laws are often challenged by advocacy groups for access to abortion. These challenges are brought to the court system and can reach as high as the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has the right to decide which cases they will review.   Their decision to see a case and/or their decisions in these cases can change accessibility to legal abortion within the United States. This is precisely what happened on June 24, 2022.</p>

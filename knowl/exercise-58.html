<p>Use the <a class="external" href="https://mggg.org/metagraph/7x7.html" target="_blank">MGGG 7x7 grid interactive tool (opens new tab)</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-65-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.11.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> to answer the following questions.</p>
<p>Even though the 7x7 grid is only roughly double the amount of spaces as a 5x5 grid, the number of possible district plans vastly increases. While it might not be practical to consider all possibilities, we can use the grid simulation to take a sample of possible district plans and obtain a distribution of results (similar to the previous exercise) among the sample.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Create a valid district plan (7 districts of 7 voters each) with exactly 22 Hearts in which Hearts wins 4 out of 7 districts. Is your plan an outlier for the distribution of voters that you chose? Use the “sample with MCMC” button to create a bar graph of results. What happens when you change nothing on your district plan but click the sample button again?</p></li>
<li><p>Change your district plan by changing 4 Hearts to Clubs which do not change the outcome of any district. You should now have exactly 18 Hearts and a plan in which Hearts wins 4 out of 7 districts. Is your plan an outlier for the distribution of voters that you chose?</p></li>
<li><p>Create multiple grids of exactly 18 Hearts but arrange the Hearts in different ways. For example, you might arrange them together in one large group, in two groups in opposite corners, or randomly scattered in the grid. For each arrangement, create the distribution of districts won by Hearts. Are there certain arrangements of the 18 Hearts that tend to result in winning more districts?</p></li>

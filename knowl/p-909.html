<p>In this module, we begin to explore the school-to-prison pipeline. After the completion of this module, you are encouraged to do more research on the topic, especially if you have not been personally affected by the overpolicing and overdisciplining in schools. It is important to acknowledge that neither race nor gender are discrete categories in the real world. However, all the data sources used in this module assume two genders and separate race categories. We will have to work with these limitations, but it is worth asking of all data we encounter: how were these data collected and what assumptions were made in collecting them?</p>

<li><p>Was there a School Resource Officer (SRO) in your elementary, middle, or high school(s)? If you are comfortable, please share what your experience was like.</p></li>
<li><p>How does the national SRO data <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-NCES-officers.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.137">[8.12.137]</a> compare to your own experience? (Note that the NCES data is only for public schools and does not separate by grade level. You can look at the <a class="external" href="https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ssocs/tables/tab_my01_2016_pr.asp?referrer=css" target="_blank">elementary</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-144-hidden.html" title="Footnote 8.10.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>, <a class="external" href="https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ssocs/tables/tab_my01_2016_md.asp?referrer=css" target="_blank">middle school</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-145-hidden.html" title="Footnote 8.10.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>, and <a class="external" href="https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ssocs/tables/tab_my01_2016_hs.asp?referrer=css" target="_blank">high school</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-146-hidden.html" title="Footnote 8.10.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> data if you are interested.)</p></li>
<li><p>What have you learned about the presence of police in schools from this module? Based on your investigations in this module, is police presence in schools beneficial, detrimental, neither, or other? Please explain.</p></li>
<li><p>What have you learned about school arrests from this module? Do you think there are too many, too few, or just the right number of arrests in schools? Justify your answer using mathematics.</p></li>
<li><p>What have you learned about school suspensions from this module? Do you think there are too many, too few, or just the right number of suspensions in schools? Justify your answer using mathematics.</p></li>
<li><p>The data that we have do not tell us with absolute certainty that certain groups of students are targeted more for school discipline. For example, while we have numbers of students who are arrested or suspended, we do not know what the reasons were for the arrests and suspensions. What additional data would you like to have to be able to answer that question? Why do you think those data are not available?</p></li>
<li><p>Solutions: What are some things that districts and states can do (or have done) to decrease the number of arrests and suspensions, and to close the racial gap in school discipline? You can do some research about the reforms already taking place in various states across the country.</p></li>

<p>No matter which side of the argument for or against abortion you may fall on, you have an obligation to present an accurate argument. The largest flaw in the argument was the claim that mental disabilities can be diagnosed during pregnancy, which in some cases is true for genetic disorders like Downs Syndrome; however, not all mental disabilities can be diagnosed during pregnancy. One strategy to address this flaw is to look at data. If someone claims that a disability diagnosis justifies getting an abortion, we should check on data about children with disabilities. One place that might give us this information is the <a class="external" href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2021/acs/acsbr-006.html" target="_blank">US Census, specifically the report on childhood disability</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-13-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.8.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a>. The report shows that nationally, from 2008 to 2019, the percentage of children that were reported as disabled increased during the time period. This is a neutral fact that participants on either side of the abortion debate can use to better defend a position. If someone is anti-abortion, then they can claim that an increase in children with disabilities means that more parents are being educated about options besides abortion and selecting those options for themselves and their unborn child. If someone is an abortion supporter, they can use the increase in children with disabilities to defend themselves against claims that they believe that unborn children with diagnosable birth defects deserve to be terminated. This is one strategy to refute this type of argument.</p>

<p>Part of quantitative literacy is being able to critically interpret numbers and mathematics in the news media. To that end, find an article from the last four years involving student loans that makes at least 2-3 numerical claims. The <a class="external" href="https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/variation-published-priceshttps://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/variation-published-prices" target="_blank">College Board website</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-168-hidden.html" title="Footnote 9.9.8"><sup> 8 </sup></a> or reputable news sources (<em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, Reuters, Associated Press, etc.) about government policy on student loans and loan forgiveness are good sources,; you're welcome to find your own sources as well. Take the number(s) in your article and do the following:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Decide what point the article is trying to make by citing these numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>Before pulling out an electronic device, brainstorm a list of questions (3-5) you'd like to know about the numbers--things that would help you understand if the numbers are big or small, and whether or not the underlying data actually supports the article's argument.</p></li>
<li><p>Get online and try to answer your questions.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Rate the article's claims on two scales:</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>How true is the statement? (0 = completely false, 4 = completely true)</p></li>
<li><p>How misleading is the statement? (0 = not at all, 4 = totally misleading) (In other words, when you look at the underlying data, does it support the article's point or not?)</p></li>
</ol>
</li>

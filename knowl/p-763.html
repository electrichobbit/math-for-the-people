<p>Now that we understand interest rates, risk, and correlation, we can begin to really look at the problem of predatory lending.  The Center for Responsible Lending (CRL) tracks payday lending across the country.  Using a $300 loan, they calculated the annual percentage rate that you would pay in interest in each state of the United States.  Note that some of the states have no rate listed - those states have passed laws which make predatory lending unprofitable.</p>

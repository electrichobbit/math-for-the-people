<p>Most lenders actually use a different way of calculating interest, called <em class="emphasis">compound interest</em>.  In compound interest, rather than just taking a percentage of the amount once, interest is calculated regularly - every day, month, year, or some other unit of time.  This causes interest to accumulate more rapidly, since you are taking a percentage not just of the original amount, but also of any interest that has already been added on.</p>

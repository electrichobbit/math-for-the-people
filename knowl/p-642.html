<p>So if the ECOA exists, banks are unable to discriminate against different types of people, right? Unfortunately, no. While the ECOA makes it illegal to discriminate in mortgage lending, enforcement of the law is very challenging.  It is very difficult to prove, in a situation where so many different factors are involved, that race or national origin influenced the lenders decision.  Many lenders use complex computer algorithms to decide whether to lend to a particular borrower.  Frequently, these algorithms are <em class="emphasis">trained</em> in a process called <em class="emphasis">machine learning</em>, where the computer studies data from past loans.  The computer finds patterns in the data, and uses those patterns to make decision about whether to lend and what terms to offer.  Because that data is based on past lending decisions made by human beings, it can (and does) contain biased decisions made by those human beings.  Research has shown that these algorithms replicate the patterns of racial and ethnic discrimination that were made in the data they are trained on.<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-mortgage-discrimination.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 6.11.1.101: Disparity in home lending costs minorities millions, researchers find.">[6.11.1.101]</a>  Therefore, although overt discrimination is forbidden in lending, it still occurs.</p>

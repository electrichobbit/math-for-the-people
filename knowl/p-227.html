<p>In this graph, the y-axis runs from 0 to 18,000 murders. On this graph, it might even be hard to tell which year had more murders unless you zoomed in or looked at it really closely. To be sure, it is horrible that over 16,000 people were murdered in each of those years. But it seems absurd to argue that there is a big increase in murders when the graph with zero as the lowest point is used.</p>

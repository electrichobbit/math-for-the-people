<p>It is clear that the author of the blog post does not support abortion. They also propose that supporters of abortion believe that children with disabilities that are diagnosable during pregnancy should be aborted, and therefore people that support abortion do not support members of the disabled community. One tacit assumption that the author makes is the claim that abortion is not an appropriate treatment for a physical or mental disability. The fallacy happens when the author states that making the choice to abort a child with a diagnosed disability is the same as not being a supporter of the disabled community. This type of fallacy is specifically called an equivocation because the author claims that two different things are in fact the same.</p>

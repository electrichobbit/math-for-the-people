<p><dfn class="terminology">Polynomials</dfn> are a special type of mathematical function, or process for turning one number into another. Polynomials are functions of the form <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+a_{1}x^{1}+a_{0}\text{:}\)</span> sums of powers of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> maybe with constant terms in front. For example, <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x+1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(g(x)=17x^{3}-234x+7\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h(x)=-x^{1}42+1\)</span> are all polynomials. The polynomial <span class="process-math">\(a(x)=x^{2}+2x+3\)</span> takes the input 1 and turns it into the output <span class="process-math">\(1^{2}+2(1)+3=6\text{.}\)</span> All numbers which make sense to input are called the <dfn class="terminology">domain</dfn> of the function, and the possible sensical outputs you could get are called the <dfn class="terminology">range</dfn>.</p>
<p>What is the domain and range of each of the polynomial trendlines?</p>

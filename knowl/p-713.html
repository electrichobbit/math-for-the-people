<p>Although it is an oversimplification of the actual situation, we'll use the credit score as a simple measure of probability so that we can see an example of how it works.  We'll treat a score of 300 - the lowest score - as meaning that the probability you pay back a loan is 0%.  We'll say that a credit score of 850 means that there is a 100% chance that you pay back the loan on time.  We'll treat every score between as a number between 0 and 100% using the formula</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{credit score - 300}{850-300}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">So a credit score of 700, in our simplification would mean a <span class="process-math">\(\frac{700-300}{850-300} = 0.73 = 73\%\)</span> chance of repaying the loan on time.</p>

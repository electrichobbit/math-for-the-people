<p>Thus, the question of who has access to affordable credit can become a question of who has access to generational wealth.  Wealth is defined as the value of a family's assets - both money saved in bank accounts and investments as well as property like homes and cars - minus their debt.  Studies have shown that Black Americans (as well as other people of color) have far less wealth than white Americans.  In 2016, a study found that the median wealth of Black households was less than 10% of that of similar white households <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-mortgage-discrimination.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 6.11.1.101: Disparity in home lending costs minorities millions, researchers find.">[6.11.1.101]</a>.  Wealth tends to accumulate in families over time.  This can be direct, like inheritance, where one generation receives wealth (money or property) directly from the previous one.  It can also be indirect.  For example, a college student may indirectly inherit generational wealth when their parents pay for part or all of their college, or when they win a scholarship from opportunities provided by their parents.  This allows them to avoid taking on debt to pay for college, which would decrease their overall wealth.  This accumulated wealth, then, gives them greater opportunities to credit in their future.  The effect of generational wealth can be seen in the paradoxical relationship between wealth and debt in America.  Even though they have 10 times the median wealth, white households have median debt which is more than twice as high as Black households <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-mortgage-discrimination.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 6.11.1.101: Disparity in home lending costs minorities millions, researchers find.">[6.11.1.101]</a>.  The debt held by white households, though, tends to be less costly than that held by Black households.  Much of this discrepancy is due to access to cheaper forms of debt like home mortgages, home equity loans, and student loans.  Black households tend to hold more of their debt in more expensive forms of credit like credit card debt and installment loans.</p>

<p>In general, though, lenders can charge interest as often as they like.  Interest is frequently compounded <em class="emphasis">monthly</em> (12 times a year) or <em class="emphasis">daily</em> (365 times a year).  In these cases, we use basically the same formula - with two main changes.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>If you pay 12% interest over the year, but you're being charged interest each month, you wouldn't pay 12% interest every month! Instead, we divide the interest rate by the number of times we compound each year.  12% annual interest would become<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{12\%}{12} = 1\%
\end{equation*}
</div>monthly interest.  If we were compounding daily, we would have<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{12\%}{365} = 0.03288\%
\end{equation*}
</div>daily interest.</p></li>
<li><p>We also need to increase the power on our exponent.  If you compute interest every month for 10 years, you're computing interest 12*10 = 120 times overall.  If you're compounding daily, you would have 365*10 = 3650 times overall.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">Making these two changes gives us our formula for Compound Interest.</p>

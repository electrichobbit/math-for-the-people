<p>Method: Study the instructions, narrative, and results for an on-line calculator that forecasts/estimates how you much you will need to save to achieve certain retirement savings goals.</p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Thoroughly review the material at this link: https://www.nerdwallet.com/investing/retirement-calculator. Note: there's no need to download the app, just work with this page and see how the numbers change and, importantly, the colors adjust on the graphics</p></li>
<li><p>Identify as many of the assumptions used to "build" this calculator - some may be obvious, some may not. Hint: A "default" value is also an assumption. There are also hidden assumptions.</p></li>
<li><p>After reading thoroughly, go through the forms on the left and "play" with the numbers - record the "scenarios" you try by listing and grouping the values you use - age, pre-tax income, current savings, monthly savings rate, etc. You can think of the differences in the "values" you select in the same way as "errors" in the previous example.</p></li>
<li><p>See if you can identify the assumption(s) or defaults which have the greatest impact on the results</p></li>
<li><p>Contemplate why this calculator is available free of charge. What is the purpose of the company making this calculator available? Hint: Where does the "Get started" button take you?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you remember to hit the link at the very top in very small print, "advertiser disclosure"? And did you click on the "list of partners" at the end of the text box?</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss and defend whether you would classify this "calculator" as good information, misleading information, or misinformation? Or, is it independent/objective 'content' or advertising? Is it "useful" content regardless of how you classify it?</p></li>

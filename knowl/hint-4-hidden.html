<body class="ignore-math"><div class="hint solution-like">Since each district has 9 voters, the minimum number of votes needed to win is 5. Any votes over 5 for the winning party are considered “wasted” votes for that party. In District 1, the Heart party wins with 6 votes, thus the Heart party has 1 wasted vote in that district. All votes for the losing party in a district are classified as wasted votes.</div></body>

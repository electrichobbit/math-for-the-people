<p>The most common way that states have "banned" payday loans is by prohibiting annual percentage rates above a certain level, usually 36%.  Consider a payday loan of $400, where the loan is due back plus a payment of $40 in two weeks.  How much money would you save if the loan charged an annual percentage rate of 36% (simple interest) instead?  Remember that your time needs to be converted to years!</p>

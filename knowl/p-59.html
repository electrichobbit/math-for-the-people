<p>The premises are the first two sentences. The conclusion is the last sentence. Typically, conclusions are identified by such words as ''therefore'', ''thus'', ''hence'', etc.  The goal of this section is to explain how to turn a written argument into a symbolic argument that can be evaluated using truth tables. It should be noted that we may need to be flexible with this translation and there are often many ways to interpret sentences as statements.</p>

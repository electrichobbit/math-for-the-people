<p>So, one root cause of misinformation or misleading information is the error in the original measurements. Sadly, much of what we are presented as “information” is based on measurements which are not physical measurements, as in the examples above, but are data arrived at in various ways. If I want to understand public sentiment about gun violence, for example, I can commission an opinion poll. There are rigorous procedures for taking polls and then doing statistical analysis on the results. But statistical error is very different from, say, the biases inherent in the person formulating the questions for the poll.</p>

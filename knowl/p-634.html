<p>Traditional bank loans are very different than a payday loan.  The interest rate is determined by risk (credit score), the type of loan, and what kind of security the borrower can offer for the loan.  Bank loans will have much lower interest rates than payday loans, but are not available to everyone.  Many people get their first loan - when they don't have a credit history - by having someone else <em class="emphasis">cosign</em> it.  A cosigner is someone, usually a parent or other relative, who agrees to pay back the loan if the borrower cannot.  Student loans are an example of a type of loan that often has a cosigner - if the borrower is a student, they may not have the credit history or security to borrow on their own.</p>

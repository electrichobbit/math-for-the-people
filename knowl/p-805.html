<p>Working as a class, use the map in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/payday-lending-rate-map.html" title="Figure 6.8.1">Figure 6.8.1</a> to calculate the total amount you would pay on a payday loan of $400 in every state.  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, the average payday borrower flips the loan 8 times, so we will use 18 weeks (the initial 2 weeks plus 8 more 2 week periods) for the borrowing time.  Calculate the amount that the borrower would pay, using simple interest and the APR rates from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/payday-lending-rate-map.html" title="Figure 6.8.1">Figure 6.8.1</a> to find how much the typical borrower would pay on the loan in each state where payday lending is still allowed.</p>

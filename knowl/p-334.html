<p>Consider the recent history of congressional districts in the state of Massachusetts. As of 2021, Massachusetts has 9 House districts, all of which have been represented by Democrats for over 25 years. In fact, the last time a Republican represented Massachusetts was in 1994 and Democrats have won 125 consecutive House elections! Despite the lopsided nature of the state's representation, their map is not controversial and has not been challenged for any type of gerrymandering.</p>

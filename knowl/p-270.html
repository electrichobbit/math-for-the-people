<p><dfn class="terminology">Racial gerrymandering</dfn> is the practice of drawing district lines to reduce the impact of racial minority voters by limiting their ability to elect candidates of their choice. This practice is illegal in the United States. Historically, in this type of gerrymandering, White people benefit from the drawing of districts that systematically stifle voters of color. On the other hand, people of color (POC) continue to be oppressed and are in a more difficult position to elect representatives to government that may fight for policies on their behalf.</p>

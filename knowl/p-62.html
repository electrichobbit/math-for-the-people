<p>Once we have converted the sentences into simple statements connected through our logical operations (if-then statements, and's, or's, negations), we need to address the punctuation in an argument. We do this by taking all of the premises and creating one run-on sentence. In other words, we remove every period and replace it with the word "and". In our example we reduce the argument to two sentences. The first sentence consists of the run-on sentence of premises. The second sentence is the conclusion of the argument. We have: <blockquote class="blockquote">If I am more than 6 weeks pregnant then it is illegal to get an abortion in my state <dfn class="terminology">and</dfn>  I am more than 6 weeks pregnant. Therefore, it is illegal for me to get an abortion in my state.</blockquote> The last step needed before we convert the argument into symbolic notation is to turn these two sentences into <dfn class="terminology">one</dfn> "if-then" statement. We do this in the following way: <blockquote class="blockquote">If  (insert run-on sentence consisting of all premises), <dfn class="terminology">then</dfn> (insert conclusion).</blockquote> We may need to be a bit flexible while reading this new one-sentence argument. In this example, it is very strange to read: <blockquote class="blockquote">
<dfn class="terminology">If</dfn> If I am more than 6 weeks pregnant then it is illegal to get an abortion in my state and  I am more than 6 weeks pregnant, <dfn class="terminology">then</dfn> it is illegal for me to get an abortion in my state.</blockquote> Instead, it is easier to read and understand the following equivalent statement: <blockquote class="blockquote">
<dfn class="terminology">If</dfn> it is the case that if I am more than 6 weeks pregnant then it is illegal to get an abortion in my state and I am more than 6 weeks pregnant, <dfn class="terminology">then</dfn> it is illegal for me to get an abortion in my state.</blockquote></p>

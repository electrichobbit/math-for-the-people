<p>Among mathematicians and political scientists, the debate about best measures of compactness continues, but consensus has arisen around a few guiding principles:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>There is no number threshold for a district being deemed “compact” - the numbers are used in comparison, not for their standalone values.</p></li>
<li><p>Compactness measures should be used across an entire districting plan, not just a single district.</p></li>
<li><p>Comparisons should be made between districts and plans within the same state, and not across different states as each state's geography is unique.</p></li>
<li><p>Compactness tests should measure the shape and not the size of the district.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple compactness tests should be used whenever possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Compactness tests should not be the sole factor used to judge district plans.</p></li>
</ul>

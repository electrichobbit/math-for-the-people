<p>According to the CFPB <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-cfpb-payday-lending-report.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 6.11.1.113: CFPB Data Point: Payday Lending">[6.11.1.113]</a>, 20% of the borrowers of payday loans eventually default.  However, many of these borrowers make one or more payments before they default.  Consider a $300 payday loan which charges a $40 fee every two weeks.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>If there is a 20% chance that the borrower defaults without making any payments and an 80% chance that they repay the loan after two weeks, what is the expected value for the lender?</p></li>
<li><p>If there is a 20% chance that the borrower defaults after making one payment and an 80% chance that the borrower repays the loan after 4 weeks, what is the expected value for the lender?</p></li>
<li><p>If there is a 20% chance that the borrower defaults after making two payments and an 80% chance that the borrower repays the loan after 6 weeks, what is the expected value for the lender?</p></li>
<li><p>Explain how payday lenders could use this calculation to make money even when lenders have a high chance of default.</p></li>
<li><p>People generally default on loans because they are in severe financial distress. Research the consequences of defaulting on a loan - what effect can it have on a person's ability to borrow money, open bank accounts, get a job, or obtain housing? How long can these effects last?</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss the ethical ramifications of loaning money to someone with such a high likelihood of default, given the severe negative consequences of a default.</p></li>

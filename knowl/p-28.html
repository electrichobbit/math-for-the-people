<p>There are a series of operations that we can perform on statements to get new statements. This is analogous to taking two numbers and adding, subtracting, or multiplying to get a new number. In algebra, the letters <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> are often used to represent numbers. These are called <dfn class="terminology">variables</dfn>. In logic we typically use the variables <span class="process-math">\(p\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(q\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> to represent a statement. When we perform an operation on one or more statements, we will call the result a <dfn class="terminology">compound statement</dfn>. It is important to note that the resulting statement is, in fact, a statement. This means that a compound statement must either be true or false, but not both at the same time.</p>

<p id="p-978">This topic may be new to you, and it also may be one that personally affects you. In this module we are primarily focusing on two aspects of the school-to-prison pipeline: school discipline (such as suspensions) and the presence of police in schools. If you have personal experiences with school discipline and police in schools, please engage with this module at your own pace and comfort level. If you know little or nothing about these topics, the following sections will provide you with more information about the problem.</p>
<p id="p-979">We will investigate the presence of police in schools first, and will then move on to discipline. Whether in contact with teachers, school administrators, or law enforcement, we will see that many students get punished for their actions, and in a variety of ways. We will want to know if these punishments are warranted and who is affected by them the most.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-78"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

COPS is a unit of the U.S. Department of Justice. After the Sandy Hook tragedy in 2012, President Obama allocated another $45 million into COPS to fund additional school police. Federal grants were supplemented by state grants and local monies to sustain SRO programs.”</p>

The majority of public schools have a part-time or full-time SRO on campus, though schools with a higher percentage of free and reduced lunch eligibility are more likely to have an SRO.

For example, the 10.26 in Arrests per 10000 column for all of United States means that for every 10,000 students in the United States, around 10 were arrested. The arrest rate for students with disabilities in 2015-2016 was 20.69 per 10,000.

<p id="p-1007">One tool that is used to model and understand probability is simulation. In this part of the module, we will be using a simulation to help us explore different probability scenarios to see which behaves most like our target. We can determine if information from an empirical model provides a stable foundation for a theoretical model, meaning it can be replicated or nearly replicated over a number of trials. We can also use a theoretical model to produce simulated samples which can let us know if different empirical models are valid. In this exploration, you will examine a data table that shows the overall population for men's prisons by race <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-BJS-report.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.132">[8.12.132]</a>. Then you will examine three different simulations to see which one you think would be most likely to produce the prison population given.  In reading the output from the simulations, there is an overall summary column presented at the left, which shows the mean proportion for each race for all of the trials. In the center, there are the summaries from each trial, meaning it shows the proportion for each race in each trial. Then in the far right hand column, the raw data is shown. The simulations model the selection of 50 individual prisoners in 25 repeated samples. The variable being simulated is prisoner race because that is what we are interested in modeling. Before you start working with the simulations (where you only need to select “start” to collect data), think about strategies that you can use to see if you think a model will match.</p>

<p id="p-1011">Notes about probability: For the exploration you just completed, the outcomes of the probability experiment you conducted were the prisoners that were being simulated. There was also a specific group that was counted to create each proportion. These specific groups were the races of interest being counted. The probability is a ratio of the specific outcome of interest over the total number of outcomes. In the simulations, we looked at different races as the specific outcomes.

<p id="p-1019">In 2011, researchers from the Council of State Governments Justice Center in partnership with the Public Policy Research Institute at Texas A &amp; M University published a report <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-Texas-study.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.133">[8.12.133]</a> based on data from all public school students in Texas who were in seventh grade in 2000, 2001, and 2002. The researchers followed these students for at least six years, with access to academic and juvenile records. Among the researchers’ findings was that only 3% of the offenses for which students are disciplined are ones where by law schools are required to suspend or expel. The other 97% are at administrators’ discretion.</p>
<p id="p-1020">The study also found that 59.6% of all the students were disciplined one or more times and 40.4% were not. The table below summarizes some of the outcomes for the different groups of students.</p>

<p id="p-1021">Students who were disciplined at school in Texas between 2000 and 2002 were much more likely to be held back a grade, drop out, or have contact with juvenile justice. These school discipline actions were 97% of the time at the administrators’ discretion and not mandated by school policies; and they had a lasting impact on a large number of students <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-Texas-study.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.133">[8.12.133]</a>.</p>
<p id="p-1022">Numerous studies have found that students who are arrested at school or who have been suspended are more likely to drop out of school and have continued contact with law enforcement. A recent study <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/school-discipline-biblio-other-harvard.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 8.12.131">[8.12.131]</a> found that in Charlotte-Mecklenberg school district in North Carolina, students who were assigned to schools with higher suspension rates were significantly more likely to be arrested and incarcerated as adults, and less likely to attend a four-year college. Furthermore, the results were independent of which students were assigned to the schools (the study took place during a redrawing of school boundaries when over 50% of the students in the district were assigned to different schools), or of factors like teacher turnover. Instead, the suspension rates were most influenced by school policies and leadership.</p>
<p id="p-1023">Since Black students and students with disabilities are disproportionately disciplined and arrested and schools, it follows that they are also disproportionately likely to drop out of school and have continued troubles with the law. This is why the school-to-prison pipeline disproportionately affects these students.</p></section></section><div class="hidden-content tex2jax_ignore" id="hk-fn-129"><div class="fn"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">codap.concord.org/app/static/dg/en/cert/index.html#shared=https%3A%2F%2Fcfm-shared.concord.org%2FfFsQ0PKR5caj6wCbidAI%2Ffile.json</code></div></div>
